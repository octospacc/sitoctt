They told me I should make the site **profit**.

In fact, if you think about it, they are right, but... there is a but.  
Since I cannot, for obvious reasons of human decency, put advertising, assorted trackers, or cryptominers on the site, I opt for something less invasive: this page.

If you like the ctt site, and want to help me improve it and update it more frequently, you can make me a **free donation**.

(_Yes, the for-profit stuff **is a joke**, it made me laugh and I wanted to write it, but the site will always remain a little thing I do because I simply like it and I don't have much better or more productive things to do Do._)

## Donate via cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are the ideal way to carry out financial transactions via the Internet, perhaps even more so for donations than for payments.

Open my Coindrop page to see the cryptocurrencies I accept and their addresses: <a href="https://coindrop.to/octt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">coindrop.to/octt</ a>!  
_Note: Coindrop requires (free) JavaScript code to run. It's a problem that needs to be solved somehow, in my opinion, but for now this is it._

_Note: ETH is listed for completeness, but the Ethereum network sucks and is unusable for fees; However, donations on the Binance network for that address are welcome._  
Should I accept other currencies in the future, for example I would be interested in trying [Nano](https://nano.org), which claims to have a low environmental impact.

If you really want, you can choose to install, on your machines, mining software for the cryptocurrency you would like to donate to me, setting the program to send payments to my address. By following this path, you don't even need a wallet for the currency in question, and you will simply use your electricity to get the money to donate to me.  
Bear in mind that I haven't been interested in mining for a while, so I don't know which programs to recommend, I would tell you to ask more experienced people. But please don't create a mining farm fueled by dead dinosaurs, oil, methane gas, I have no idea, just to donate to me (or, actually, don't do it in general, please)! The best would be to use a [Rasperino Solare](./Posts/2022-06-23-0000-Rasperino-Solare-ed-Altri-Esperimenti-Andati-a-Male.html), if you can.

## Donate via gift cards

Another good way to exchange money over the Internet, in my opinion, is with gift cards.

I am currently accepting gift cards for these stores:

- Amazon.it

To send me the code of a gift voucher that you have and would like to donate to me, consult the list of my public contacts, where you can message me and do nice things ðŸ˜¸: [Who-I-Am.html#-My-contacts](./Who -I'm.html#-My-contacts)

## Donate via cash

If we ever see each other in person, you can easily make a cash donation to me!

At the moment, I definitely accept the following tax currencies:

- [EUR] Euro

The list here makes known the currencies that I definitely accept, because I have the opportunity to put them to good use.  
If you have cash of any other currency with you, and you really want to donate it to me anyway, I will probably accept it, but know that it is very likely that I will never be able to use it, and your donation will therefore have been in vain.

## Donation history

In this section of the page I will keep a history of donations.  
It will be private by default, so I will never attribute the identity of the person who donated to their donation unless I am specifically asked to do so.

I still don't know if I will report all the donations in general, therefore also including the anonymous ones but simply without specifying who they are from; or I will only mention those of people who want to get their credits, avoiding writing the others. Maybe I'll decide when the first anonymous donation arrives? :)
