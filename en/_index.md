Once upon a time here it was all countryside— er, I wanted to say... it was a whole list of words piled together badly and worse. Not only did I no longer like it either, but it's not exactly good manners in the year of our Lord 2024 (and beyond), so...

Now there is this list of all my latest articles, and loose pages that I have recently updated, while the old home is at ["Sul sitoctt"](/it/miscellanea/Sul-sitoctt/) until I reorganize everything. Welcome<code class="notranslate" data-lang="it"><!--
--><span class="BlinkA">a</span><!--
--><span class="dn">/</span><!--
--><span class="BlinkO">o</span></code> in the ✨sitoctt✨!

(Work in progress for a few more days, so maybe broken links and misshapen pages, sorry!!!)
