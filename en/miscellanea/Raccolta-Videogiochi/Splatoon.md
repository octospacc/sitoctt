Title = "🐙 Splatoon"

{{< noticeAutomaticTranslation it >}}



Third person shooter which to say is different from the others is an understatement. Splatoon breaks the genre's expectations of war realism, and features cute, dazzlingly colorful gameplay that never lets up. There are no humans shooting bullets with iron, but squids spilling ink.  
Playing in Mollusc Melee (this is the name of the 4-on-4 online battles) is fun, but the depth of the game and the inventiveness of the development team can be seen in story mode.
