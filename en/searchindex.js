Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nIt's not often that new ideas come to mind, but when they do, they're always just the right amount of bizarre... Without digressing too much, it's precisely because of this development of things that years ago, for the first time, I found myself compiling the Linux kernel from source ‚Äî on a Raspberry Pi 3 among other things, which in hindsight I wouldn't recommend ‚Äî and now, precisely yesterday, again another time, after years (this time on the PC, luckily ), for a purpose that I won't spoil.\nWhy recompile the kernel? üòØÔ∏è Linux is based on a monolithic architecture, which would be of little concern to us... if it weren't for the fact that it has an inconvenient implication: any function that works at the kernel level must be compiled into it. Even the mechanism of the so-called modules does not cover all possible situations (at least not on a practical level), and one can therefore find oneself in situations in which the kernel provided by the distribution (or by the hardware manufacturer), even if updated, does not have something that is needed, and therefore must be replaced.\nConsidering the infinite variety of Linux distributions, repositories that distribute compatible or non-compatible kernels, and combining this with the diversity of individual options that can be enabled in kernel compilation... not only in rare cases is compilation from source the only way, but often it is the most practical one. Luckily, compiling the Linux kernel is very simple ‚Äî significantly easier than the average Linucs desktop application, with three thousand always conflicting dependencies ‚Äî but there are perhaps not-so-immediate details in the process, so‚Ä¶ here's my note! 0. Departure and prerequisites üì¶Ô∏è This note is on the more generic recompilation of the Linux kernel, i.e. the official variant (that of Linus Torvalds) on and for an x86_64 (or AMD64) desktop PC. No forks or patched variants, no crappy OEM versions, no installation on embedded or otherwise esoteric devices, no distributed or cross-platform compilation. For more or less borderline cases, the things to do can vary more or less, even if the trend remains the same... you see, come on, the point is that I assume this situation. In my case, there aren't even proprietary kernel modules.\nAside from any favorite tools for obtaining the kernel, unpacking it if necessary, and some distractions to pass the considerable time, the prerequisites are quite minimal. At a minimum you need a C compiler (gcc) for obvious reasons, GNU Make to run the makefiles, some assorted tools with a forgettable name and some super-specific libraries of limited interest. Then, I think other packages may be needed, depending on the Linux distribution in use or the features that need to be compiled.\nIt's not actually very clear on the web which packages are really necessary, and which ones someone who has done other guides said \"well, let's put it in just to be safe\"... I'll update here with precise price lists as I check, including excessive planks if necessary (for those who are okay with wasting space but not time). For me it is generally a strategy to install the minimum possible when some requirement is not clear, start the compilation, and install any other dependencies as errors arise in this regard.\nDebian and derivatives (apt):\nbuild-essential libelf-dev (required) ncurses-dev (to use TUI menu configuration) 1. Obtaining the code ‚õìÔ∏è Linux source code can be taken officially from main Git, from Torvalds GitHub , or from the Kernel.org site. I prefer the last option, which has the latest versions actually needed displayed prominently, up to the oldest supported branch.\nThere are several versions supported at a given time. Generally, if there's no reason to install an older kernel, a newer one is better; not too new, however, because living on the bleeding edge means losing blood, with occasional even serious problems that can pop up! So, I avoid the mainline branch, updated daily or almost, like the plague, and generally choose stable, updated with a little ' more days. Other users might legitimately prefer the more recent longterm (the one at the top), for even more stability, but I find it useless.\nFor each version line, apart from the date, what matters is the [tarball] link, so you download that file there. You can then extract it to a convenient folder, among many ways, with the tar xvf command. All commands to be executed from this point will be inside the prepared folder.\n...You should also download the PGP file, when present, which serves to verify that the download is intact and that it comes from legitimate distributors. Realistically, however, not all versions already have it (implying that deep down...), the download is done from the official site with HTTPS (so it will be difficult to alter), it is a compressed archive (so if corrupted it should fail the extraction), and doing the verification is a mind-blowing pain in the ass. Other institutions will have higher security requirements, but for private users it's frankly just boring, I don't do it, I don't care.\n2. Kernel configuration üî©Ô∏è Configuring the kernel is the most intricate part... because you can't execute commands by inertia, but you have to choose what you actually need to, well, have the kernel with bone options. There are, as mentioned, infinite configurations, and different ways to use them. The main point is that there is a huge text file, with various options (mostly Boolean), that you can edit.\nTweaking that thing by hand is crazy, though, because there are neat menu-based tools built into the build process to handle the various possibilities. Here too, half a mess, but the choice is mainly between two programs TUI and GUI respectively, which can be invoked respectively with make menuconfig and make xconfig. I prefer xconfig for convenience and, although I have used the curses menu configuration in the past, and it is quite intuitive for me, apparently for many it is not... and the how to use that menu is not today's topic.\nmenuconfig vs xconfig If you do nothing else, the configuration you are going to change is the default one of the kernel as it is being developed. I have never had any problems using that as a base, but, if necessary, in addition to those shared by other users, you can use the one from the current distribution. Depending on how your system exposes the kernel configuration, you can (typically) read it with cat /boot/config-$(uname r), cat /boot/config, or zcat /proc/config.gz. Just write it (\u003e) to the ./.config file to apply it to the current configuration.\nIn this case I wanted to activate support for the new NTFS driver, so in xconfig I press CTRL+F, search for \"ntfs3\" and set to (Y)es the option that talks about \"NTFS Read/Write something something\"; then, I save the configuration, I close, and... I'm done, incredible.\n3. Compiling the code üßëu200düç≥Ô∏è With compilation, it's boring time, because you simply have to give the computer time to crunch millions (!) lines of code. It's not good, but at least it's not the end of the world: on any PC that isn't exactly a hack you should do it in less than 4 hours. On the Raspberry Pi 3 it took me a day and a half with the CPU at nuclear temperatures (and also for this reason I advise against it...), but on my PC (Ryzen 3 3200G, 16 GB of RAM of which a few are occupied by compilation, on a low-end SSD) I think it took me just under 3 hours to compile version 6.10.7.\nYou simply need to run make, and Linucs will make itself for the current CPU architecture, long live the magic! Better yet, make -j$(nproc) to use all available CPU cores... The handful of hours, I should point out, are measured against this, otherwise it would be half a day , since my PC has 4 cores; it could do much sooner by having more cores, because it can compile even more files in parallel effectively.\nAt least in the first few minutes, it's a good idea to keep an eye on the terminal, to see if any errors occur and the compilation stops. Absurd errors have never happened to me, but, as I said, if you don't install all the dependencies, something related to those could come out... in this case, you install what's missing (referring to your distribution), and continue with the previous command.\nDepending on your configuration, you will need more or less disk space to complete the compilation. While the kernel itself never weighs more than a few MB (and the modules a few tens of MB), the folder at the end of the day weighed ~22 GB, so it's a good idea to either make sure you have enough space, or check every now and then that this isn't ending. And if it ends during the process, you simply free up space and continue, again, as before. (As long as your file system doesn't get corrupted just by being 100% full, right BTRFS?)\n4. Installing kernels and modules üèóÔ∏è You don't need root permissions to compile the kernel, which is handy in case you want to temporarily steal someone else's most powerful computer to do the job... but, to install, you obviously need those on the current system. Here it is not only simple, but also quite fast (maximum a few minutes): by running (as root) first make install, and then INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 make install_modules, they will be installed in the appropriate paths, respectively (assuming you have not changed the names): the kernel image (vmlinuz-x.x.x-...), usually in /boot and modules, usually in /lib/modules/linux-x.x.x-... . The modules are files separate from the kernel, because they are loaded by the system when necessary... the point is that some of the many are used to complete the boot, so they must be installed.\nYou also need to prepare the so-called init file system, or initial ramdisk; normally it also ends up in /boot, under the name initrd.img-x.x.x-.... And this step would be quite inconvenient if there were no kernel-install, script included with systemd, or its alternative installkernel. Having systemd, at least the first one should already be installed, and in that case (assuming the names from before) just do (as root) kernel-install add x.x.x-... /boot/vmlinuz- x.x.x-...; alternatively, with the second, installkernel x.x.x-... /boot/vmlinuz-x.x.x-....1\nNote: those who develop with the kernel (not those who are reading this post, I'm afraid) may want not to set the environment variable INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1, because debugging without the debugging, which that flag removes, is difficult... but for ordinary mortal users like me they just waste space (so much so that distributions package them separately). Furthermore, those who do not necessarily develop with the kernel, but have to compile external modules or do other tricks, should realistically also install the corresponding header files on the system: make headers_install (always as root). At least on \"complete\" distributions, make install and then kernel-install should have already configured the bootloader too, at least having GRUB. In the case of, so to speak, \"more DIY\" distributions (which I don't use, btw), as well as more unusual boot configurations... that's not my case, so I know nothing, and I won't say anything. Boot configurations are a beast for another time.\n5. Test the core üí•Ô∏è If the kernel is installed, and the bootloader has been correctly configured, then simply restart your computer to enjoy. It is good to remember that, if you are using GRUB, some say that the new kernel is not selected as default, and you have to choose it manually from the boot menu... but in my case, on Linux Mint Debian Edition, it seemed to me that instead it had actually been set as default.\nAgain, if, thanking the penguin, the system finally boots, just use the uname -r command to check the running kernel version. At this point, it's a good idea to verify that the desired configuration is actually working... but how to do this varies from feature to feature, case by case. To at least confirm that the specified configuration exists, just check the current kernel configuration as in point 2.\nAt this point, if everything works and no other changes are needed, you can also delete the huge compilation folder, and the kernel will remain. If you also need to uninstall the kernel in the future, just delete the previously installed files normally and reconfigure the bootloader appropriately.\nConclusion üéäÔ∏è Being able to compile the kernel from source code is another of those things that we Linux users can do, and that Windows users frankly don't envy us. But that's because they like to win easy, with their NT, based on a microkernel design... that's right, now that the point of the article is over I can spout nonsense as I like.\nCopium aside, compiling Linux can be something fun to do at least once. If you find yourself in uncomfortable situations like me it must be done, there is little that can be done; However, if you just want to have some silly fun, maybe one of the many things you can do is compile an ultra-specific, super-optimized kernel for your machine, or for virtualization purposes. And, sure, it consumes some energy, but never as much as mining cryptocurrencies or rendering nuclear missiles in Blender!\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References The decorative cover image is obtained via Microsoft's generative artificial intelligence.

Regarding this thorny issue, I also wrote an article: üìÑ Documents should not become applications.Anyway, though.. to provide some extra functionality, I have to have some JS, there is little you can do.

By standardization, they all assume full color support (where possible).\nMy useless digressions on absolutely absurd ways of consulting the sitectt (Expand) ‚Ä¢ Web browser, with full CSS3 support (Perfect!) ‚Ä¢ Print on holographic paper, fully rendered GIF and CSS3 where possible (Requires moving the paper by hand but excellent!) ‚Ä¢ Web browser, with incomplete CSS3 support (Meh, OK..) ‚Ä¢ Print on plain paper, CSS3 animations and non-rendered GIFs (Boo, animations are missing..) ‚Ä¢ Old browser (Old Web, Text Web, or Gemini) / Print on plain paper, no CSS support (What is this rubbish?!?!) But what is it about? On this Internet space of mine I will put everything. I hope.\nFor now, I definitely put up shallow pages on specific topics, but also long, conversational blog posts. I also want to put up lots of collections on the things I like, in both textual and media form. A kind of gallery of things that are valuable to me.\nIn addition to the actual contents, however, I want the site (the Web version, obviously) to be a gallery of itself. I want to create something that has its own unique character, like the amateur websites of the years 1995-2005, where every place on the Internet always had a different atmosphere from everything visited a moment before.The rise of social media as we have them today has unfortunately ruined the web from this point of view, leading to complete standardization and the death of creativity expressed through form.I want this web space of mine is different from all the others, characterized by monochromatic text and recycled themes, because it is a shame to have very powerful tools and not really exploit them.\nFor this reason, I will constantly try to invent ways to embellish the pages with CSS, not only with layout or fixed text effects, but above all with animations.To the rest of the form, such as the tree order of the pages on the site or paragraphs on the pages, I won\u0026rsquo;t think much, otherwise I get distracted from creating content and the desire passes.\nSite availability At the moment, this site is available for browsing on various different addresses (the contents are always identical). For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, however, the name changed a month ago to sitoctt from postoctt, because the old name gave me the impression of some postal service\u0026hellip; I should also think about many other cloud mirrors from different providers (obviously free), if I want the site to survive octt itself and stand the test of time\u0026hellip; But this is a long question.\nWeb The website is available from several sources.\nOn the clearweb HTTPS, on the GitLab servers: sitoctt.octt.eu.org. On the Onion Web (Tor), on Replit servers: sitoctt2fxjvx3lc2iqqef2aeulflprjaasv2xl4zi7sxxbmvjy5b5yd.onion. In the end it is no longer hosted in my house, but maybe it's for the best, it's one less load for the poor little makeshift server I have (at the moment, a Nintendo Switch console with Ubuntu the Raspberry Pi 3). üíæ Compatibility options for obsolete or exotic systems (Expand) ‚Ä¢ Basic HTTP version The site includes complex and relatively modern CSS functions, in order to provide epic graphic (and functional) effects. Ironically, although viewing the pages on really old browsers, which lack total or almost total CSS support, everything looks ugly but is readable... on browsers that are both too old and too new very serious bugs appear, which make it impossible to use some menus or even read the text!In addition to the fact that (where possible) I want to support old systems, these damned problems also appear on less popular but current devices, like the Kindle! In short, for too many browsers that do not include a setting to completely disable CSS, it was a must to do what I did: to the path /Plain on my domains clearweb there is a parallel root, and pages with the same content but CSS reduced to the bare bones. ‚Ä¢ Unencrypted HTTP To avoid problems I dedicated a dedicated subdomain to it, keeping HTTPS forced on the main one; but, since it doesn't require maintenance, I made sure that from the fifth (!) level domain \"http\" you can access the site via unencrypted HTTP ( hosted by GitHub, this time): in short, the address is http://http.sitoctt.octt.eu.org. The contents are identical, of course, but finally you can browse the sitectt on stuff like Internet Explorer 4 directly by contacting the server. Gemini From now on, the CTTT site is also available as a Gemini capsule. To go there, you have to use a Gemini browser.Obviously (for those who know Gemini), everything is more neutered, and the form is not exactly the best because all the pages are a direct conversion from the HTML of the website ( and the program I use to do it is a bit broken, too).Go to the octocapsule, kindly hosted by koyu.space: gemini://koyu.space/octt\nFeeds and notifications From now on the site (the blogoctt and the MicroBlog, specifically) has integrated feeds, which are automatically updated when I publish a new article!\nAtom Feed (modern, recommended, contains complete posts): feed/atom.xmlRSS feed (obsolete, available for compatibility): feed/rss. xml\nYou need a compatible feed aggregator to use them.- On desktop PC I recommend Thunderbird o SeaMonkey Mail.- On Android I recommend Feeder or Simple Rss.- If you want to use a device like an e-ink e-book reader, the only universal software that - among other things - includes a feed aggregator, which I know and can recommend, is KOReader.- Tip: If you use Friendica, you can copy the link to the feed and paste it into the search bar, to be able to follow it as if it were a profile!\nFurthermore, if you use any platform of the Fediverso ActivityPub (Mastodon, Pleroma, Misskey, ...) you can follow the bot of the ctt site, so as to receive new posts in your Home feed: \u003c a href=\"https://botsin.space/@sitoctt\" rel=\"me noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@sitoctt@botsin.space! For some complications that started at the end of August 2022 , the bot is not accessible from the largest Italian Mastodon instance, mastodon.uno, so it is almost practically useless now. I'm not taking it away just because it would cost me more to do that than to leave it where it is :P; However, I would have to create a new one, sooner or later.

But, for those who don't give my online profiles the necessary attention: it's okay, you've discovered it now.\nNo longer going to school, it is inevitable that an entire calendar year has passed for me without ever writing the classic essay and, although I absolutely do not miss returning home with a broken shoulder and a maimed hand - the result of writing hundreds of words by hand on paper and then even producing a fair copy ‚Äî I have to admit that not having to write is quite sad.\nObviously, since I like writing, I have never stopped doing it on my own, in fact, I have increased the frequency quite a bit.

The name is a ball, yes, so the I would immediately stop quoting the MIUR text and get to the point; first, however, the track:\n(Click to expand) Proposal C2: Text taken from: Maurizio Caminito, Profiles, selfies and blogs, in LiBeR 104, (October/December 2014), pp.39-40 . When the way of reading and writing changes, the most consolidated ways of transmitting one's ideas and thoughts to others (or to oneself) also change. And there is perhaps no literary (or para-literary) form which, in the era of the so-called digital revolution, has undergone a mutation equal to that of the diary. The secret diary, understood as a notebook or notebook in which thoughts, reflections, dreams, hopes are jotted down, strictly linked to personal enjoyment or (re)reading, no longer exists. Not only because it has changed shape, leaving on the ground the appearance of a treasure chest variously defended by the curiosity of others, but because it has undergone a real reversal of meaning.\nIn her diary, Anne Frank told her life story to a fictitious friend whom she had given the name Kitty. Among other things, he writes to her: ‚ÄúI am very afraid that all those who know me as I always am, will have to discover that I also have another side, a more beautiful and better side. I'm afraid that they will mock me, that they will find me ridiculous and sentimental, that they won't take me seriously. I'm used to not being taken seriously, but only the 'light' Anna is used to it and can tolerate it, the 'more serious' Anna is too weak and wouldn't resist it.\"\nWho today writes in solitude anymore, writing words on the sheets of a notebook to which only he (or she) has the key?\nWho seeks, through the diary, the discovery of an \"inner silence\", \"the deepest part of oneself\", which will constitute, for the writer, the foundation of the encounter with others?\nThe first elements to disappear were the temporal dimension and the procedural nature of diary writing, not so much in relation to daily life, but in relation to the gradual formation of the personality.\nThe diary of the digital age is a representation of oneself immediately addressed to others. It was born as an artificial construction, conscious of, or rather in an almost spasmodic search for, the judgment (and approval) of others. Thus risking losing one of the essential elements of the diary as we have known it so far: the search for oneself through the telling of one's inner experience. Which is replaced by self-affirmation through the mythical (or in intentions, mythopoetic) narration of what one would like to be.\nIn the passage the author reflects on the change that diary writing has undergone due to the success of blogs and social media: express your point of view on the topic and compare yourself critically with the theses expressed in the text. You can divide your essay into appropriately titled paragraphs and present it with an overall title that synthetically expresses its content.\nWhat role do blogs have? At the risk of being (even if it were just seeming...) a broken record, I repeat: this is not a topic, don't run away, I beg you! As much as I like to keep the experience of this writing genuine, that is, starting and finishing without going to look at how others on the internet have followed the same path as me, I cannot help but approach the topic in my usual ways, as with the other articles on my blog, also telling my personal story, and... do you understand, at this point, why I say that \"it's meta\"?\nAs a bizarre girl on the Internet who always has to make herself known, I couldn't help but talk about blogging on my own blog, taking as inspiration some text that comes from a book; something that is part, so to speak, of the old frontier of sharing one's thoughts with the general public... something that however has not at all been supplanted by new technologies. However, it is inevitable that, in our world, made up of mortal beings with limited time at their disposal (that dictator always comes back into play...), every new thing that arrives must always (at least in part) replace something old, otherwise we wouldn't even talk about it, because no one would ever even know about it... so, where's the catch?\nDiary against news Blogs, in fact, have not eliminated books, which are still written and read at full force (at least, relatively), but upon their arrival they curiously took the place of something opposite: the diary, a form of intimate writing par excellence, generally never aimed at public enjoyment, and certainly not open to second-hand comment or sharing. To develop his thoughts, the author of the text starts from this assumption, which is objectively true: many people who lived before the Internet, whether I know them or centuries ago, used to keep the classic personal diary in a one way or another... while today, despite l (non-functional) illiteracy is at an all-time low practically all over the world, something with exactly those characteristics is not at all common. What happened? Do people magically no longer have personal thoughts to process and retain? Obviously not: the ways have simply changed and, this is the point of the discussion, the objectives for which it is done.\nIt should be clarified not to ridicule the text, but simply to establish a more accurate context, which can be read a mile away from the fact that this was written in 2014: while it also rightly talks about social media, from what little we know only thanks the track can be said to focus mainly on blogs, but blogs are as good as dead after ten years. Ten years are practically a historical era in the information society, so much so that blogs in the strict sense actually didn't even have time to kill the diary, before being killed in turn by social media (including some that they are so-called microblogs, but not only). Personal websites dedicated to the public writing of one's ideas are carried out by only two categories of people: digital artists and/or technology nerds (here I am), and those for whom writing is first and foremost a job (writers, journalists, researchers, etc...), who in their free time also dedicate themselves to a more informal but still substantial form.\nNowadays, unfortunately, normal people are content to use social platforms in a banal way, and to do increasingly micro blogging, because the fashion that existed in the early years of the new millennium was immediately eclipsed; in a sense, the standard of average blogs has risen greatly, as they are now used intentionally to critically address issues and spark \"engaged\" discussions, and are increasingly less collections of daily memoirs. This detail, as anyone in a similar position to mine knows well, is not as small as it seems, and it is right to keep it in mind for later.\nDiary become novelty Regardless of which technologies are preferred by young people today, the point of those two pages remains: digital has distorted the concept of the diary, which today exists first of all as a means of exposing oneself, and not to gather. The topic is particularly interesting, since today's situation is not only a consequence of technological evolution, but of the evolution of society in relation to that of technology. For most people, myself included, the idea that writing one's thoughts digitally is more comfortable, flexible, intriguing and safe than the romantic but too old pairing of pen and paper is acceptable; however, using a virtual medium does not automatically mean giving up secrecy or introspection.\nAnyone can very well compose files on their device and leave them there only for themselves, perhaps even protecting them with encryption, undoubtedly safer security than a creaking padlock using a mass-produced key. In fact, it's technically even easier to keep things to yourself than keeping one of the modern online diaries, which requires you to create a profile, configure settings and, in extreme cases, even pay attention to what you write, so as not to end up banned from the service. But then, why don't we write in private anymore, even though it is easier than in the past (although, certainly, at the same time, writing in public is also much easier than in the past)?\nMy complicated story I have tried to find an answer to this question a few times, for years now, at least since I stopped using the various digital platforms superficially. In reality, in fact, since late childhood I have been sharing what I want to say in one way or another thanks to the Internet, having first started with YouTube (doing gameplay and some computer tutorials), and then very slowly becoming passionate about creating sites web in early adolescence, and using chat groups both throughout this time and a little later. However, it never happened to me that I wanted to share, systematically and with a more ethereal audience, things that were more private or not strictly related to my digital activities, until I started using Instagram for short periods, some time after the explosion of stories.\nIn any case, these are volatile things (as the nature of the format required), which if I hadn't been able to publish there would probably have ended up simply forgotten, in some lost chat or in the black hole of my gallery, because I had never perceived the attraction of keeping a personal register in which to write my little things. Most likely, and this is perhaps also due to my emotional immaturity at the time, the format also instilled a bit of fear in me, not really being able to imagine what I would have to write in the long term, and above all why never; on social media at least I could meet new people with whom I could share opinions, passions and moments of lightheartedness, giving them the opportunity to get to know small fragments of my life just as I could get to know theirs. Later, however, Instagram was starting to get boring, and I stopped using it for good.\nFrom Telegram onwards At this point, for a good while I didn't really share anything in particular about myself in public, but I did talk in a few chats, and usually not about directly personal things. Sometimes I shared memes, and I continued with them, having after a few months also created a very small Telegram channel where I reposted several (very, very cringe and not at all kek). Small detail: Telegram is a messaging service, but it has always played the role of an alternative social platform for many, to the point that even those behind it have worked hard on it over the years. Up there every now and then, in such a spontaneous way that I had almost forgotten about it now, I happened to send ironic messages of my own, or reply to those of the other administrator. Some also referred to things I did or that happened to me, but the focus was never really on me.\nTo tell the truth, little by little the publications I created on that channel slowly increased over the months, until, almost randomly, with a pretext that is actually a bit 'Funny, I didn't have the idea of creating a second channel where I could only publish spontaneously, without the uncontrolled reposts of memes. This channel (which in reality was also born with two new admins, but where I was still the one talking more), has perhaps over the months actually become a sort of diary open to the public, with me publishing less and less at random, and on topics that were slowly less and less virtual, but without me even realizing it, because two hands weren't enough to count all the layers of irony. In the latter case I am simply talking about OctoVoLTE, which in the past 5 years has evolved together with me and my way of writing, still existing today as my very active microblog, as I mentioned in 'start.\nThe \"greve z√¨\" era In part, it is right now as I write that I realize how, in that public place, I was gradually looking for a sort of secret intimacy over time, but which was not a real isolation. It started out as a place to make jokes about me or shallow personal moments of mine, but over the months and years it increasingly became a place to write about things that were more private and that I felt like I couldn't really say anywhere else. Meanwhile, I became progressively more and more mentally unwell, for reasons that were totally unintelligible to me and to others at the time; certainly writing on the channel, to also have a few laughs about my inexplicable problems with other people, was in this sense helpful in venting and distracting myself, since I wasn't actually able to resolve the issues that lay beneath those constant messages of mine, ironic but perhaps objectively worrying.\nHowever, just as the stakes increased, I started to feel that writing all that stuff like that, in public, wasn't okay. Not that I was ashamed to show them to the little people who live on my computer, otherwise I wouldn't have started at all, but specifically I worried about what might happen if those who know me in person were able to read. In part I already had very few real friendships and I wanted to avoid blowing them up badly, showing myself as obviously ill as well as simply weird, but in part I was perhaps also afraid that my parents would find out something and get worried, or they would ground me, or go figure out what... Realistically, using a nickname that I had never used before, it would not have been easy to find the channel for someone who knew me in person and would have tried to look for it, but... sometimes the goddess Luck tends some very bad jokes, so it was more than logical for me to make the channel private, so that I could continue writing as I was doing, without worrying about the possibility that someone could link my contents to my physical person.\nAn unexpected diary If I think about it a little (even if, after all these years, I don't have a precise idea), perhaps even in this now semi-private diary I didn't write everything I would have liked, and that I would have I could in total confidentiality, but I still shared many, many things. So many that, wanting to convert the channel back to public some time later, I had to delete all the messages older than a certain amount, because I'm pretty sure I've shared things that, although totally harmless in themselves, if appropriately triangulated with enough patience would have made it possible for any malicious actors to obtain some of my personal information, and this is not the case; However, the time needed to review years of messages, to delete only the few at risk, would have been too much, so first I made private copies, and then I made the uncomfortable decision to delete everything in complete silence (with a script).\u003c /p\u003e In any case, I have vague memories of having perhaps written loose private notes in those cases in which the channel was not enough, but the thing never took root in me as an activity to research, because otherwise the channel satisfied me as a register of the days. Before recently, however, I still didn't realize that this channel of mine was nothing more than a modern diary, because in my head the diary was something written in a certain way, and not at all associated with a sequence of messages (albeit chronological), written perhaps in broken Italian, and with stupid images in the middle.\nTowards the Fediverse I know I seem largely out of track at this point but, first of all, on my site I'm in charge; secondly, however, what I want to illustrate is how, up to a certain point, my digital writing existed for the purpose of expressing myself in an extremely genuine way, without those denaturations brought by the mechanics of the Internet, despite being in public. This, in fact, until I rediscovered the archetype of the most traditional social networks, thanks to the Fediverse. Even the stones should know it by now, but, when in doubt, it is right to reiterate what the Fediverse is on a practical level (and not a technical one, a topic that does not concern us today): it is an environment in which there are social platforms very similar to the more or less commercial ones in vogue, in their functions, but which are not controlled by Big Tech , they are not based on abusing users for profit, they communicate perfectly with each other rather than being so-called \"walled gardens\", and moderation is very effective. There are tons of them, but the platform I started with was Mastodon, very approachable being similar to Twitter and having the largest Italian community (at the time the only one with a good critical mass, in reality). On paper everything seems extremely positive, and I started to get closer and closer to the world of federated social networks, meeting many nice people and very few worrying ones (which is not a given on commercial social networks), starting to slowly put more and more emphasis on 'having my microblogging there, rather than on the Telegram channel ‚Äî which to be honest was becoming very stagnant, with so many people no longer active, but no one new discovering it and coming.\nIt's about this time that a certain decline began, and the thing that I hadn't realized before was a diary, now I wasn't realizing how it was less and less of a diary, with each new message I sent on any of my profiles. One of the considered strong points of the Fediverse is that (for better or worse, net of some very limited experiments) there are no algorithms that propose the various posts to users, but rather these arrive only chronologically (as Twitter also did in the ancient times). The reason why this would be positive is that, since there is no machine that decides based on secret criteria (and difficult to exploit in its favor) which messages to propose more at the expense of others - something that Big Social uses precisely to keep its users glued as much as possible to the service, all in the name of profit and often in defiance of any morality ‚Äî users would not only have real control over their experience, but could express themselves authentically, without having to choose between pleasing the supreme algorithm or having a post that will not be seen by a single soul.\nThe dilemma of numbers As in everything, however, the more complex a system is, the more it contains entropy and unpredictable variables (and a social network is in this case a truly ideal one), and the more its reality deviates from ideal principles; in particular, since time is a tormentor, how can something not go wrong if you give it total control? Whether they are proprietary or community-based, the big problem with social media is the numbers, and the climb to increase them more and more: thinking about it now I realize how, every time I shared something in those cases, the priority was no longer expressing what I felt in a given moment, but to express what perhaps I felt like, but at the same time it would have allowed me to accumulate more numbers than the previous time; and, when this didn't happen, the disappointment was palpable.\nI have never really abandoned the Telegram channel, sometimes using bots to automatically republish from there to the federated world and vice versa, and simply doing it by hand in extreme cases. I never reached the level of downloading data from the federated network to calculate interesting statistics and thus have a strategic advantage over others, but only due to lack of time, because the desire was strong... but I certainly did some mental calculations, regarding the moments in which to publish something, and at what pace, in an attempt to obtain those additional single impressions, which would then have to be transformed into at least a few retoots, so as to generate some other impressions and so on. All for what, then, to reach new followers who, due to the temporal ordering, would have usually missed my posts anyway? This is the thing that, at a certain point, made me lose patience, and a good part of my interest: the problem was not that what I wrote wasn't interesting, because the interactions arrived when the stars were well aligned, but that no person ever noticed them because of the system... which is exactly what the Fediverse promised wouldn't happen. The situation got extremely worse when - it seems like a paradox - many new users began to arrive who had fled from Elon Musk's Twitter, cyclically, every time he said or made one of his huge nonsense: having more users, there are certainly many eyes more (2 for each user!)... but alas, inevitably the background noise also gets a lot louder, and getting a message to someone who might appreciate it becomes a real undertaking.\nIt scares me to think that I've been trapped in this situation for more than a year, having reversed it just a few months ago by pure chance, and that I'm only now realizing it all. Even though I had already declared all my attempts to expand my kingdom to have failed, this was still a bug stuck in my head, and the interest I had lost in composing a digital diary in a manner disinterested by others did not magically return; for a good period, therefore, on the Telegram channel the most I sent were memes with personal comments, and sometimes the story of things I did while spending my time with computers, but without that intimate atmosphere that was once central .\nThe right wrong solution I practically have to thank fate for how, totally by chance, last December, the idea of moving to the WordPress content manager to manage all my publications came to mind; the idea was to be able to retransmit everything automatically on Telegram with a bot, and on the Fediverse via the dedicated plugin, so as to resolve the constant doubt about where to publish what, and to simply be able to go back to writing as in the past. Looking back now, this idea also had a harmful basis, being based on this sick thought that I kept gravitating towards, but the result was totally positive, despite it not being what I wanted at all; this is precisely why I have to thank luck. It's been since I started going with this new pace that I think this topic deserves an article in itself (just call me \"procrastinator maxima\"), but the key point of these last few months is that I've almost returned to the literary splendor of the past. Unfortunately and fortunately, my times as edgelord1 are a closed chapter, but of things I still have a lot to say, in fact...\nGetting used to the new system, and how it was more convenient to write there than on Telegram, I started to get into the habit of writing a lot in single posts; something that not only blew away any chance I had of relevance on the Fediverse, but actually even made a couple of old followers (not too many, thankfully) turn up their noses. Initially, I was a little worried but, for some reason, this time, the desire of my intrusive thoughts to leave my mind intact to be distributed with dignity into the ether won, and not the desire to continue adapting to commercial mechanics. I called it simply \"microblogocctt\" when I started, but, now averaging more than a thousand characters per post, I realize that calling it a microblog is a bit out of place by modern standards ‚Äî they are just some substantial diary pages ‚Äî but that's the beauty of it. Enough time has passed by now to say that it's no longer about the frenzy of new software, but instead I'm really enjoying the experience as a whole. Of course, I necessarily have a completely different way of writing compared to the past, but at the base there is the same strength that once animated me.\nMy final diary Having only recently realized that what I once had was a diary, and what I still wanted is practically a diary, I also had the pleasure of discovering one of the key features of this format: how cool it is to end up reading something written months or years before, comparing that past snapshot with the present context, perceiving the differences between the different \"versions\" of one's person without even having to think about it too much, reflecting on everything and projecting one's mind to an old positive moment; or at least, a negative moment from which, thanks to writing, one was ideally able to draw something positive. The moments in which, to say something new, I somehow end up linking to past posts are particularly special: not only is it an excuse granted to me by fate to look back at what I wrote at that moment, but it gives me the impression of the continuous development of everything, is proof that the things I choose to write do not follow one another at random and do not remain an end in themselves. I only regret it when, busy with very heavy commitments or with my mind running out of ideas, I skip a day without writing anything, because it is another opportunity to add to this fading literary baggage of mine; However, making a worry about it would mean once again losing sight of what you are doing, because it is normal that in everyday life there are moments that are not only good, not only bad, but also terribly banal and irrelevant, and therefore cannot be transformed into letters.\nAt the same time, however, writing in public remains a prerogative for me, not only because of the possible immediate search for interactions with other people, but also more generally because I like the idea of building a real knowledge base, which anyone can read in the future, to have fun or to reach deeper reflections, exactly as I do with other people's notes; exactly as we all actually do by reading those words, written by individuals, that history has brought down to us, after their death.\nThe reality of social media All this, there is no fuss, is in direct contrast with the direction of social media. The technology behind it can actually support somewhat anachronistic ways of doing things (otherwise my system with WordPress wouldn't even work), but that's not the direction users are going in any case. If you adapt to the system you have the chance to win some recognition, but if you don't adapt you are guaranteed to lose: it is therefore not difficult to understand why the majority of people on the Internet live in the cage that I felt for a bit'. Leaving aside any fashions, which by definition come and go, the system does not allow for someone to be seen in their lowest moments, because sadness and compassion do not generate the same involvement that anger, boasting and envy do. they assure, and therefore: if something is unpleasant, there must be a culprit behind it to take it out on, because sterile complaints are annoying; and, if something is pleasant, then it must somehow instill a desire in those who look at it, or it must somehow be the expression of a desire, otherwise it doesn't matter. Practically, in itself the act of publishing on social media must generally be an attempt to elevate oneself to a myth.\nIt's clear that I'm generalizing, but, if you think about it, the things that make a splash on social media can always be traced back to one of these categories, because - once again it returns - human nature is pretty tough. The result of this equation is that, in the attempt to obtain something for oneself, one ends up writing only for unclear others, who can only appreciate them if at that given moment they don't have something even better in front of them. Predictably, people here generally don't re-read their older posts, they don't reflect on their past selves by looking at what they produced, and I know that in reality many have no problem deleting old posts after a while without retaining any backup, private or not. The latter, among other things, is also the direct consequence of another mechanism that social media imposes, namely the continuous pursuit of the freshest topics, with a pace that makes it difficult to stop and reflect, with the final result of having writings that lose all practical sense hours or days after publication.\nSomething halfway between the crisis Wanting to close as I started, it must be said that the environment of Telegram channels (and those specifically, because, apart from self-managed microblogs like mine, there is nothing else on the same level, for ordinary people) is peculiar, in that it still seems like a middle ground between these extremes. Much more than in other online social places, users who create a channel as strictly personal there, as long as it is not linked to a specific theme, end up publishing a bit of everything, or almost.\nIt's easy to see, simply by walking around, that this is the case, and that some of the publications have a similar smell to what mine had in the early days, with several administrators also sharing their flaws, as well as the victories . In all likelihood, the exposition is probably filtered anyway ‚Äî we can simply see what is published, but we have no idea what is never said ‚Äî and certainly the introspection is nowhere near the levels of the diary it once was ‚Äî the format reduced to very few words at a time makes looking back to make comparisons tiring and distracting, especially looking for old \"pages\" - but, evidently, the fact is that the classic alternative is no longer attractive. Even in these cases, however, there often remains the desire to reserve ourselves from those who have a certain weight on us; but, unlike Anne Frank, who in her limited situation could not do anything but use her imagination, thanks to the Internet we can find non-imaginary friends with whom we can confide in each other, and in the meantime perhaps even share some laughter, opening up our diaries.\nThe important thing is attention I think that my experience, illustrated in this way, almost speaks for itself, but to conclude: taking into account the average user, it is true that the move towards blogs first, and from shortly thereafter until today social networks and microblogs, it changed the standards of diary writing for the worse. It's too easy to lose sight of the real reason why our soul makes us feel we have to write, ending up chasing fame, following those who ran before us; telling, just as Caminito suggests, a myth of the self, on a support which, to be truly useful, should instead tell the totality of the self, and do so to one's own self.\nUltimately, I believe that it is not impossible to keep a totally public diary on the internet, inevitably distorted in its form, but keeping the deepest meaning unchanged, and therefore writing exactly what past generations would have written in their own chronicles; undoubtedly, however, it is easy to stumble. I must confess that even now, sometimes, I perhaps thought a little too much before writing something, despite my new awareness and desire to really want to use my microblog to express myself freely, but... one advantage of WordPress is that I can write in public when I feel like it, and simply save in private when that's not the case; so, in reality, now it no longer happens that I avoid writing something just because I couldn't share it, but I simply follow the flow, I do what I really feel, choosing case by case and therefore living correctly, and I would advise you to do the same. same. It doesn't matter whether it's mainly private or public, keep a diary, but do it well!\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References The decorative cover image is obtained via generative artificial intelligence by Microsoft.\nI can't find a perfect definition of edgelord in the sense I mean, but this one from Urban Dictionary comes close: an edgelord is someone who likes to share their whole life on social media and make it very dramatic so people will feel bad for them. they like to pretend to be depressed on their snapchat stories - example ‚ÄúDONT HMU üòîüíî‚Äù stuff like that. they also like to listen to emo rap like lil peep and ghostmane.¬†‚Ü©\n","date":"June 22, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2024-06-22-%EF%B8%8F-On-the-transition-from-diaries-to-blogs-to-social-media-a-reflection/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Because searching on the web I can't find a shred of an announcement page or one that collects the jobs. Too bad.\nAnyway, a creator I follow took part in the competition, and so I happened to play his creation. It actually took me longer to prepare to play it than to actually start and finish, because I was obsessed with wanting to play it on mobile rather than on PC. But, the important thing is that we did it (and I explained how on my microblog, in case it's useful to you). At this point, however, I also felt like doing a small review of the work... why not?\nThe review So, this is LIBERTY WINGS, \"a simple game about freedom, with cool airships, dictators, and... a cute goth girl!\". I'll spit it out right away, and tell you that yes, it's a cute RPG, I liked it. Precisely for this reason, and also considering that it is really short - the first gameplay done completely blindly without running should last from 20 to 40 minutes - in reality I immediately refer you to the videogame web page, where you can download it and try it on your own, first to continue reading: https://yomuu.itch. io/liberty-wings-rm95-game-jam. If you really don't want to... let's move on. At the very least, if you plan to play it, perhaps consider skipping the story section now, or at least not going beyond its first few paragraphs; although I will try not to spill all the details and characters, I will still expand quite a bit.\nThe story The game, as can be read from the description (which is not immediately clear when starting to play, but which can be understood as you progress through the story), is set in \"a not too distant future\", in which humanity is divided into states established on flying islands in the sky. With a war, a dictator took control of these states, turning them into colonies of a centralized government, the \"Company\".\nThe protagonist of the story is a normal employee, without precise characteristics or identity, who finds himself having to carry out one of his normal tasks when the game opens. In reality he, as well as all the other workers of the Company, is evidently characterized more as a slave: he has worked and lived there since he was born, and to all intents and purposes he lives to work, due to the brainwashing implemented by the regime dictatorial. Like his colleagues, he is convinced (and partly self-convinced) that life is all about duty Returning to the protagonist's normal day, for some reason he is constantly full of thoughts, from the moment he gets ready to carry out his tasks until he goes on his lunch break. Among his ruminations, thoughts continually crop up which, from the point of view of the ethics of the company and of the model worker, are, to say the least, wrong. The boy tries to give it little weight, but he can't help but go from the ideal of being grateful for his life and his work, to the more problematic question of who he really is as a person, and if perhaps in the world there is something of a higher value than the obligations imposed on him from above. The tone of the first type of thoughts, however, comes across as slightly false, forced, almost as if they came to the surface automatically only to avoid the worker from a more serious existential crisis.\n","date":"April 7, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2024-04-07-LIBERTY-WINGS-a-Short-RPG-about-Freedom-Review/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Not having made it in time for the 30th, here I am posting late at night, before mimir. üåå\nIn recent months I haven't had the opportunity to deal with the site perfectly, because my words have been stolen by alternative outlets, or perhaps a little blocked by setbacks. And what exactly, I imagine you might ask yourself who diligently follow the CTTT site, but only the CTTT site, and otherwise never wallow in the scam?\nThe BBS, Spacc forum with an ancient flavour During this summer I had a slightly unusual idea, at least by 2023 standards: opening an old-fashioned discussion forum for hustling, with the vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding something that could slowly grow into a place ideal for discussions of that kind, taken beyond the practical boundaries allowed by the most modern social platforms or chats. And here he is proud, there on https://bbs.spacc.eu.org/\u003c/ a\u003e. üòé\nI have some moderately ambitious future ideas regarding the Spacc BBS, which I have not yet had the opportunity to complete and/or set in motion, due to issues of skills and time; from the connection with ActivityPub, to the multilingual support with translation in the backend, up to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa role-playing game that would take place in the forum with ad-hoc designed code (in short, a real video game, not like on other forums where people talk and we pretend to play)... and who knows if I will ever be able to accomplish everything, especially not being able to find people capable of providing the pieces that I am missing.\nHosting the forum costs me nothing, whether it is used or not, and for this reason alone I don't think I will ever declare bankruptcy or close down. It's really so convenient to host at home.\nAlthough I have not exploited it to extreme levels, I have used the BBS to write some posts that otherwise I would perhaps never have launched, because I feel that in some way the forum format (even in those cases in which no one queues the thread even after weeks of waiting...) offers me a particular way of expressing myself, which I would sometimes feel unsuitable on the blog.\nOn the other hand, who knows, maybe having only the blogoctt I would have published there, feeling that the MicroBlog certainly would not have been a suitable alternative. Speaking of which...\nThe brand new MicroBlog, so much for Du Rove The \"MicroBlog\" that I have on the ctt site is not really a microblog in the classic sense... it's a category that I arbitrarily decided should keep my shorter posts. I have always practiced true microblogging partly on the Fediverse, partly on Telegram, with a channel that has historically continuously switched back and forth between public and private for complex reasons.\nAt the same time, these platforms have always also served as \"PicoBlog\" for me, with posts of one or two sentences, while I let the dust form on the section of the site. üï∏Ô∏è\nOn the one hand I had tried to move to my own site for these things, because I wanted to have a way to really control my data and the management of publications... but with the static one it was all quite inconvenient, and the desire to publish I got over it. On the other hand, a small problem was my having to choose every time between publishing on Telegram, and therefore often not being able to effectively share my words even outside that bubble, and publishing on the Fediverse, being able to replicate the posts on my channel only with obnoxious limits (which lowered the experience and made people complain). At the end of the day therefore, months ago the desire to micropost began to wane more and more... and I don't know exactly how I spent my days then (perhaps administering the technical side of the forum...), but I started posting more rarely. Just this December, however, everything changes, after one night I can't fall asleep immediately, but on the other hand I remember that...\nThe ActivityPub plugin for WordPress should have made some decent progress by now, and could almost be suitable for microblogging... ...and it so happens that I have a WordPress site on Altervista (therefore, unlimited space and traffic but with complete WordPress, free) that is in disuse, which would be perfect for trying this little thing... This thing perhaps deserves a separate article, but the fact is that I immediately put this way to the test to change my microblogging workflow for the better, after having flaunted it on the new MicroBlog note (https://octospacc.altervista.org/2023/12/04/138/ , this is for example the message in question). üîó\nBillionaires' platforms leave everyone stranded As luck would have it - ironically, on the evening of December 24th, as if it were a bad, rotten gift - the Telegram account where I was the admin of my channel and of the comments group was banned, for reasons that we still haven't understood (clearly automatic, and in my opinion incorrect). As it is, it also seems that I have lost all my data forever: if they don't respond to my manual request for data portability, they will have violated the GDPR, and in the meantime I will be left with nothing in my hands (if I I'm not freaking out...)\nLuckily, having started publishing from WordPress, the ban didn't interrupt my shitposting flow in any way (phew!), but I had to waste some time catching up with people (and there are those who don't we have still collected) to finally bring it to the Matrix (a federated and truly free messaging protocol)... because unfortunately they didn't want to listen to me when 2 years ago I said that it would be wise to move there before accidents, not after. üòÆ‚Äçüí®\nThis stuff also deserves separate discussion, and just for good luck I'll leave some of my new links here:\nThe discussion about the ban on the Spacc BBS (with references also to some very hot MicroBlog posts, I went crazy live): https://bbs.spacc.eu.org/viewtopic.php?t=160 The Matrix spacc \"space\", which I've never really had a chance to promote before, you might find it hilarious if you join: https://matrix.to/#/#Spacc:matrix.org I dismantle everything However, all this also means that it's time to review some little things on the site.\nThe section that is now called MicroBlog there is no longer right - because with this name it wasn't right before - and I have to either remove it (by pouring all the posts present there into the Blog), or rename it. I would lean towards the first option, so as to reduce for a moment the fuss that I would otherwise have to make when deciding when an article was long enough to be in the Blog, and when it wasn't. At the same time, the PicoBlog will disappear (becoming an archive, I don't delete anything). I didn't update it before anyway, and even more so I doubt I'll ever use it now. The eternal return of the Knowledge Base I'll try to be brief here, because by now this issue risks becoming the biggest inside joke of my life, which, just look at it, equally deserves the elusive separate article. ü´£\nFrom more than a year ago, as I also wrote on the ctt site, I started using TiddlyWiki to create my own knowledge base of... I'm still not clear on what.\nLet's say that above 90% are lists of links that are useful to me, of which 30% perhaps with short personal notes, and the remainder of the content made up of small pages of notes and things like that that I wouldn't really know where to throw otherwise. It's public because it's convenient for me, it would be more inconvenient to keep it private, and I think it can be useful to other people, just as the personal wikis of other random individuals have been useful (or at least interesting) to me.\nThe point is that, since I've been using that little thing, I have practically no reason to update the non-blog pages on the ctt site, because it's just more inconvenient and less organizeable in the long term, compared to creating them from scratch wiki.\nAdding to this also the now having to recognize the failure of statioso (the generator of my site, which is a spaghetti, difficult and annoying to extend), but while my complaint about the fact that I can't find other generators that are satisfactory for me remains true, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransferring everything to TiddlyWiki comes naturally to me (which, yes, works excellently as a generator of static sites)... üôÇ\n...It's a shame that it's not easy to recreate all my special pages and particular internal functions with the templating and macro system of this otherwise magnificent software, and so I've been working on it since March 2023. In all honesty, what happens is that I work on it for days, then I stop out of boredom, then I forget about it for a good month, and then I start the cycle again as late as possible.\nAt this rate, who knows if sitoctt and OcttKB will ever truly be merged into one source... they will finish the bridge over the strait first, those there, this matter about me. üôÉ\nThe time that passes away... This section risks not making the slightest sense, but I wanted to write it anyway, partly for atmosphere and partly out of desperation.\nThere has never been any doubt that time cannot help but flow, leaving behind everything that has been past and that constitutes the present because there has been no way to change it. However, time seems to be less and less useful, more volatile, less tangible. Entropy rises, regrets crystallize, divertissement appears to be an increasingly less effective way of escaping trouble.\nBut, dramatic jokes aside, this is what I really feel, especially when external circumstances remind me of it: speaking in the short term, despite having eliminated some of the things that led me to waste time, it seems that I have less and less available; regarding the long term, every now and then there is a strong feeling that the time really available to materialize, despite all the justifications that my brain invents to eliminate the pain, is almost running out. üò∂\nThe end. Let us therefore hope - because it is generally right to never stop hoping, even if perhaps it is not a good idea to use hope as a substitute for action - that this new year can bring us many equally new but truly beautiful things, even if I have no idea how this could happen.

Between games that in one case are comfortable to play and in another maybe don\u0026rsquo;t even run, and the saves that are spread across countless different devices, solving this problem completely will never be possible\u0026hellip;\nYet, sometimes, the entropy of the brain is able to generate particularly useful ideas in this regard too, as happened to me the other day for the PS2.\nIn fact, I have a real PlayStation 2, a home console which when you find a way to use it is certainly appreciable\u0026hellip; and which I often found myself not using, for the reasons mentioned above: neither directly, because I often don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it at home, nor with emulator on the smartphone, because I would feel that at home I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use the real console since the updated saves would only be on the phone.\nAnd then, just the other day, staring at the console (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why), I think there should be a way to have the saves easily synchronized between it and the phone\u0026hellip;\nProblem 1: USB stick or memory card? At the time, the simplest idea I thought of was: there are adapters to use a microSD card like PlayStation memory cards (which instead use a non-standard interface)\u0026hellip; it might be better to buy one of those, so I keep all the saves there, and if desired I can also access them from other devices by moving the card around.1\nWith a card of several GB (there aren\u0026rsquo;t any small ones around anymore anyway), furthermore, I could even do without the USB stick and keep all the games only on the memory card!\nLuckily, this is not the only way, at least for certain games: Open PS2 Loader, the homebrew that runs commercial games from backup memories (like USB sticks), supports the use of virtual memory cards (VMC) which are saved as files on the USB drive. Games are quite slow to save on that (the PS2 only supports USB 1.1, plus there\u0026rsquo;s some strange overhead), but it\u0026rsquo;s a seemingly workable solution.\nHitch 2: Save conversion Regardless of the previous choice, however, I discover another obstacle: the saves should be converted to be passed from the console to the emulator (at least AetherSX2, for better or for worse the only truly decent one to date ) and then vice versa.\nFortunately, I immediately found mymc, a program so old that it requires Python 2 (while at the moment we\u0026rsquo;ve been at 3 for years and years), but it works, and thank goodness it offers a command line interface.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t do true virtual memory card conversions per se, but it allows you to manipulate the files contained in it in various ways. All very crude, but fortunately exploitable enough to do just what I need, after assembling an ideal script.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t try to explain how it works, at the bottom of the article you can download it and read it, it\u0026rsquo;s boring. I packaged mymc inside the script, so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be installed separately.\nHitch 3: Converting from your phone Note 2023-10-18: I found a modern fork (in Python 3) of mymc, mymc+\u0026hellip; haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it (yet), but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that this could work on Android too, eliminating the fiddly setup that follows, so I mention it.\nUnfortunately, mymc has some problems working in Termux (the very convenient native Linux environment for this type of integrations) on my Android: I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s to blame, but in practice the program has problems reading VMC files, throwing an error of the type file.vmc: Bad file descriptor. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any solutions online, not even for general searches of the problem, so I had to make do. Maybe using a containerized GNU+Linux system in root, with its libraries and a different build of Python 2.7, would be enough to solve the problem, but who knows.\nFor my part, I was starting to get annoyed, and so I opted to delegate the conversion to my Debian server, having a Termux script carry out the simple task of loading the VMC on the server, running the actual conversion script there, and then download the converted file to the right location locally.\nBefore I forget: on Android 13 and above (but already from some past versions) root permissions are needed to read and write files from/to external memories (such as the USB stick) and private application folders (such as the one where AetherSX2 preserves virtual memory cards).\nFrom what I have been able to prove, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have root you will necessarily have to use a suitable file manager (and I don\u0026rsquo;t think there are scriptable ones, so you have to use your hands), or perhaps ADB, to move the files around\u0026hellip; thank Google.\nIn any case, my scripts have written in the special paths used for all the ambaradan.\nUsing Termux:Widget, I finally added two shortcuts to my system launcher, for VMC conversion:\none that goes from PS2 to emulator format, to run when I want to play on my phone but the saves on the pen drive were last modified by the PS2; the other for the reverse conversion, to be performed when I want to go and play on the PS2 once the emulator has updated my saves. To explain it I realize that it seems very complicated, in practice I just have to press a button and wait a few seconds.\nIn practice: the value of unique memory Once the problems have been eliminated, the configuration is done, and its strong point lies in the centralization of games and saves on a single device: the USB key. In this way:\nI avoid the confusion generated by games that I have on one side but not the other, especially when I want to modify my collection; I don\u0026rsquo;t need a much larger microSD in my smartphone to contain all the games I already have on another portable memory, with advantages for the stability of the other data and the weight of the wallet; there is no extra confusion for managing saves too, these being managed as I said before. On the PS2 I normally attach the pen drive when I need it, however on the smartphone I have to use a USB-C OTG adapter, which is on average inconvenient but there is little that can be done. To avoid losing these things around, I then attached a carabiner to the USB stick, and a key ring in the hole for the lanyards on the phone cover.\nIn conclusion: chain ideas I believe this is the most ideal system given my initial conditions, and in the following days I will test it thoroughly.\nHowever, I will probably have to get a larger external memory to store more games, because the 32 GB one I use now has always been too small for me.\nMaybe, by taking a large enough one, and writing a specific homebrew, I think I can adapt this system of mine for Wii games too, using the same memory for those too\u0026hellip; spoilers? üëÄ\nIn true end, here are the additional resources for this article:\nMy initial question and brief system discussion on Sony Hacking Zone: https://t.me/SonyHacking/46784; Guide to using VMC on OPL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=tBrKcJC_E4U My conversion scripts (on GitLab): direct, [via server](https://gitlab.com /octospacc/Snippets/-/blob/main/Ps2EmuVmcConvertCloud.sh); AetherSX2 Android build I play (latest without adware): https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/aethersx2/aethersx2/aethersx2-v1-4-3060-release/aethersx2-v1-4-3060-android -apk-download/. On this finding, I find conflicting opinions or advice that is not too clear, so be careful: it is not clear whether these adapters also work as normal memory cards for saving games (and therefore also possibly as cards for FMCB), or only as external memory for homebrew like OPL\u0026hellip; in any case it would be a potentially valid purchase, considering the technical drawbacks of USB on PS2.¬†‚Ü© ","date":"October 17, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/note/2023-10-17-2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-Gaming-synchronized-between-PlayStation-2-and-smartphone/","section":"NotesüìùÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nFor a strange set of reasons, this article sat in my drafts for more than a month, even though it was practically finished. Oh well, better late than never, happy reading...\nSo: somehow, one day my mother's name day mysteriously arrived, and I therefore found myself wanting (having to?) give her a gift.\nBut what gift to give? It's always a mess with these things. Even at the Chinese housewares shop, that magical place where if you turn around you discover things on the shelves that you couldn't see before, sooner or later, the gift ideas run out. Let alone elsewhere.\nFortunately, although I lack good taste, I believe I have plenty of creativity, and for this reason once again my only real option was do-it-yourself. (But I bought the raw materials from the Chinese anyway, and where else...)\nI enter into housewares without having too precise ideas in mind, but with the plan of wandering around a bit, seeing objects that are more or less dissonant with each other, and waiting for my brain to invent something.\nIn the end, I bought two items:\nA set of 10 paper clip style hair clips; of slightly different colors, to have an acceptable variety, but all in a solid color. A box of beads of different shapes, sizes, and shades of color; 8 types in total. However, each box only had about one shade of color, a slightly limiting but not serious factor. I got a set with colors between purple and pink. \u003c /p\u003e Just ‚Ç¨3 later, I get home straight away with the desire to do the job, and I don't even start when I'm already on the verge of making a mess: when opening the little box of pearls, I was tilting it a little too much, and some of those colored crumbs ended up from one compartment to another... a little more carelessness, and I could have lost at least a good part of them across the room in an instant.\nMy idea was to place the smaller beads (~1 mm in diameter) all over the top edge of the clothespins. The larger ones are almost like pebbles (~4mm in diameter), there's no way they'll stick together at all. Especially when you are in the situation of having to do all the work in just a few hours.\nIn this case I therefore had to use hot glue, whose greatest advantage, the almost immediate grip, was however a slight flaw, because gluing these beads properly requires a certain precision; at least in the way I initially tried, that is, letting a few beads fall onto the clothespin from my fingers after placing a little glue.\nWith this method, I should have gotten there sooner, yes and no only a quarter of the colored pebbles stuck (badly), and the rest ended up everywhere. So I tried it again, this time dipping the glue-covered clothespin into the bead container, and this method actually worked a little better.\nHowever, this way is not magical in itself, and has not been able to solve other problems:\nThe beads don't hold much on the sides, where the body of the clothespin becomes thinner... promptly, after enough open-close cycles, they all come off. In general, when opening or closing the clip, some pearls will pop off even after the glue has completely dried. In any case, by doing this movement about ten times, you can ensure that those who really have to fall do so at least immediately, avoiding problems later. Meanwhile, in the frenzy of everything, I had beads going right, left, on the desk, on me, and then on the floor. While doing the opening and closing, some even splashed into the air...\nMost of what I lost I found again in the next few days, however, when I walked around my room and felt something crunchy under my slippers. I couldn't find a very small part, obviously, also because in the meantime I vacuumed shortly afterwards.\nIn the end, after making these 3 for my mother... I almost started wanting some made like this too though! üòÖÔ∏è So I made at least one more, but this time, having infinite time, I tried with vinyl glue.\nI don't know whether the decoration made in this way is water resistant or not, because my vinyl glue is so-called \"washable\", but I don't know if it can only be washed with water or soap is also needed. I'll avoid having it rain on my head when I wear it, I guess.\n\u003c /p\u003e Despite this potential risky side, I think that using vinyl is still the best choice, for an aesthetic reason: when it dries completely, it becomes totally transparent. Hot glue, on the other hand, remains dense and visible, making the final work look dirty and messy. It's fine when I have to join cardboard or fabrics, but not in this case.\nAfter a few days of use, however, I noticed that the vinyl glue does not stick very well to the rubberized plastic of the clothespin, and it has come off slightly at the edges. Nothing serious, but it should be kept in mind; to solve this, I think it is enough to add a little more glue (vinyl or non-vinyl) which also goes around the side of the clothespin and incorporates it slightly.\n\u003c /p\u003e So, in the end, my mother had a product that was almost not even truly complete, compared to the more refined one that I created just a moment later! üíÄÔ∏è Her real gift was therefore acting as a beta-tester. I then offered her to rearrange the first three clothespins a little, but she said that, at least those three, she wants to keep them like that, and at most she'll make her some more new ones. Well, I don't know what to say, there are those who prefer to use betas for life, apparently (absolutely not me about Minecraft...).\n","date":"September 15, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2023-09-15-Hair-clips-reduced-to-glue-and-pebbles/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

But at the seaside, of course. In your opinion, who has the most authority in this regard: all those unknown people who every time, almost acting by inertia, punctually choose the mountain again, hoping that in some way this umpteenth time could be the good and fun one... or the 'very Italian poet poet, Gabriele D'Annunzio, who in particular seaside locations experienced summer months so profound and memorable that he felt the irrepressible need to write about an entire collection of lyrics?\nI have spent these days in profound quiet, lying in a boat in the sun. You don't know these places: they are divine. [...] I think about the time when I will have to get back on the train, with unspeakable regret. I would like to stay here, and sing. I have such a vehement desire to sing that the verses arise spontaneously from my soul like the foam of the waves. In recent days, at the bottom of my boat, I have composed some Lauds that truly seem to be children of the waters and rays, all penetrated by air and saltiness. I feel that in a month or two I could compose the entire volume in one go. [...] If you could imagine the beauties of this marina!\n(Letter from D'Annunzio to Fratelli Treves Editori, 7 July 1899\u003c /a\u003e)\nAlthough, like many, I am also convinced of the fact that the sea - understood as being chained in the same single seaside resort chosen for the holiday on duty - is tiring for a long time, in some cases I too am able to feel in a particularly engaging is that naturalist essence that D'Annunzio was able to transcribe with extreme difficulty into beautiful words, despite my holidays being decidedly a little more flat than his.\nIf perhaps during my short holiday in Calabria I didn't have the opportunity to take spectacular walks in the pine forest, or to enjoy a walk on the beach done as nature dictates - without the August crowd and the sensory overload generated by it - and not even staying for hours in the absolute peace of some glimpse to rest, I still couldn't give up that one moment of immersion that I'm truly allowed.\nAfter several of those days in which I reluctantly had to decry the sea water as unsatisfactory - too cold, too rough to even stay on the shore without rolling away, overall uninviting atmosphere - finally today between late afternoon and first evening the cards on the table are the right ones, which allow me to make that most desired move: peeing in the sea.\nAt the beginning, my idea was to just stay on the shore, distracted and with my head full of other thoughts. However, in a few minutes the environment proved to be extremely enveloping for the senses, and my thoughts slowly aligned themselves with the frequency of the waves. Following this new calm and welcoming rhythm, then, I push myself a little further into that vast blue, getting wet up to my waist, there in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nBy now I feel good in the water, and in the moments that continually follow one another I begin to forget all the shapes, colors, mental constructions. The sky shaded with a warm blue, a fresh color stained by the warm shades of the sun which is now about to set, thus putting an end to this last day of holiday. I do not perceive all those no longer necessary elements, works and thoughts of the modern world, totally out of place in such a divine context, and I delete those other few people very distant from me.\nWith the blink of an eye, I therefore go back hundreds of thousands of years, if not tens of millions, to when all the broth of life was being prepared in the enormous oceanic pot, inside which today we can no longer live but from which we still feel an ancestral call.\nIt is at this point that, after my mind and my skin have totally merged with the blue body, the rest of my flesh is completed in this temporary hybrid entity, which at the same time belongs to me and of which I am not Nothing. That stimulus, as old as the scenario that has naturally come together by now, is now the only definable complex thought that goes back and forth between my nervous system and the urinary system. Thus we build a need that has the appearance of a longing desire, but which we begin to realize on our own, as if it were almost a gift of fate, without any notable effort on my part.\u003c /p\u003e This. This is the single only moment in today's world when we can appreciate the simplicity of such a gesture. Deriving pure satisfaction from something that we consider obvious, and to which we generally don't give a shred of attention: all the other times we pee we always have something on our mind, and we always see the act as small as yet another chore to do constantly, not like a little well-deserved moment of break a few times a day. I am personally guilty of this.\nIn this long moment in the Calabrian sea, quite deep even at a distance not excessively far from the shore, the only even possible distraction is the infinite panorama between the horizon and it costs. No moment is ignored, but rather each of those countless moments increases the awareness of pleasure, while waiting to finish the job; but to be able to crown the anticipated satisfaction, not to run away from the cup as usual.\nThe most pleasant aspect of the work is undoubtedly the warmth of the liquid now released, which induces relaxation and gives us confirmation that yes, we are doing the thing more beautiful. The swimsuit is always in place, never moved a millimetre, but you can't feel it at all, it doesn't offer the slightest resistance to the mixing of the only two fluids in play. It's the highlight of everything, the pinnacle of panism.\nIn the end, everything ends, but that's good. We, extremely limited beings, would not even be able to appreciate an experience of this type in this situation if it had a different duration. At this point, with extreme calm, without starting to fill my head with useless thoughts again, I start to get out of the water, which has become certain. I enjoyed this special moment, and that's what counts.\nFinal rating: 10/10. An experience that in its pleasant essentiality is truly inimitable. I highly recommend it to everyone, and I would certainly do it again at the next available opportunity.\nBefore concluding, a little curiosity: the sea is the oldest bathroom not divided by gender in the world. We humans did not invent this particular tertiary category of waste disposal places to remedy the mistakes of some of our ancestors - nature invented them, well before the very first homo sapiens existed! p\u003e","date":"August 11, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2023-08-11-%EF%B8%8F-Review-Pip%C3%AC-nel-Mare-Tyrrhenian-Sea/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nNote: This article should have first explained the Switch dock issues, but then continued and ended with \u003etotal development of my alternative solution. The first part was quite long, however, and I'm afraid that it might eclipse the really important part, that of my dangerously original solution. So, in this article I only talk about my problems; what comes out later will be dedicated to my do-it-yourself.\nWhoever, like me, is among the unlucky owners of a Nintendo Switch console, probably knows well how the official dock is not only uncomfortable, but almost a joke in essence, something that almost shouldn't have existed!\nHere's what we're talking about The dock, for those who have been blissfully ignorant until now, is simply a proprietary base that provides some expansions to the console, including only one with minimal importance: the video output.\nTo avoid creating confusion, or assigning blame where it may not be due, let me clarify: all this article revolves around the first edition of the dock. In fact, Nintendo created an improved version when it released the OLED revision of the console in 2021. I only own the first model (as I only have the first edition of the Switch), so my experience is limited to that. Oh well, even if it seems that some minor problems have been resolved, overall the dock still remains sub-optimal.\nHere is the place where the dock should be: in the trash.\nFor what began the end It's been since the proverbial day-one, that day in 2017 when Nintendo released this yet another console strong\u003e on the market, which among the various criticisms that have arisen around it, many have also concerned its relationship with the dock.\nVideo output made ugly The biggest annoyance, in my opinion, is due to the fact that the damned dock is the only way to have video output from the console to an external display. We all understand not wanting to put an HDMI port on the tablet, i.e. the actual console, but why necessarily require the dock?\nAlready 3 years before the release of the Switch on the market, i.e. from 2014, the \"standard\" was widespread DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C Connector\u003c/ em\u003e\", the one currently implemented in all those portable PCs that do not include an HDMI port, and which precisely allows you to transport, on a single connector: sufficient energy to charging, video data, and data of all types (USB).\nIf you then want to have extra USB ports, or directly an HDMI port (to connect to non-DisplayPort monitors), there are hubs on the market for less than a few dozen euros that are right for this case .\nObviously, since Nintendo wanted to implement its questionable proprietary solution, connecting Switch directly to a monitor equipped with a USB-C port, or to one of these adapters, will not result in \u003c strong\u003eno video signal be transmitted.\nNintendo then made sure not to include wireless video transmission functions, not even as a secondary option, even if homebrew programs like SysDVR demonstrate that the hardware is perfectly capable of a broadcast video via WLAN.\nFor another thing, the Miracast standard has been around since 2012 , so there was plenty of time to implement it in the console, if only the parent company wanted. To tell the truth, since it is something implementable via software (the only hardware requirement is Wi-Fi), Nintendo has never had a deadline to include such a function, yet no firmware update released in these 6 years has yet filled this gap (or various others); something that does nothing but confirm the laziness of the company.\nA blow to the wallet! Despite this Nintendo fixation with not implementing widespread standards ‚Äî or, even worse, with doing it incorrectly, reinterpreting them and breaking them (I don't dare open my mouth about Switch issues that go beyond the base...) - at least the dock is included in the package of the console, and does not have to be purchased separately... something that I don't know whether to see as good or bad, considering that, costing 80 euros if purchased separately, I imagine that its inclusion in the tablet box \u003c strong\u003eheavily impacts what would otherwise be the cost of the console alone.\nIf it is also true, however, that critics arrive even where someone offers a perfect product, this plasticume accessory deserves all its bad reputation. I mean: all of us gamers would have expected something a moment better, with that bounty of ‚Ç¨80, and therefore it must be said that \u003ethe negative aspects of this ornament honestly weigh much more than the positive sides.\nBan the doors First of all, I find it a little ridiculous - albeit realistically insignificant, considering what competing consoles and other electronic devices in general offered in 2017 ‚Äî that the dock provides only one digital audio-video output port (HDMI), and no analog.\nI repeat, it is not an intelligent excuse to go to Nintendo with pitchforks in hand, but it is at least disappointing, considering that the previous home console of the great N, the much-maligned \u003eWii U, had both releases.\nA lack of input/output considered a problem by far more than 4 cats, however, concerns the Ethernet port. In specific areas, Wi-Fi has never really replaced wired network connections, and gaming is one of these.\nOn Switch then, with the Wi-Fi drivers of Horizon OS (Nintendo's operating system), which is to say disgusting is a compliment, and with the lack support for USB tethering drivers (those that allow you to use, for example, an Android smartphone as a wired router), the only way to have a connection \u003c strong\u003eQuality Internet is buying an Ethernet-USB adapter (at least this one, fortunately, can be generic).\nYet, in this case, the lack of space is not a digestible excuse for not having included plenty of ports... the dock inside is \u003emostly empty space, rather than electronic components, and I think it would have been possible to do more (the OLED dock, in fact, at least has an Ethernet port).\nBy the way: in itself, the lot of ABS plastic wouldn't be a problem ‚Äî on the contrary, it gives good solidity and a weight compared to the product , which otherwise might tend to fly off tables and desks with little effort, and would perhaps be a little fragile. Due to this, however, the dock is not at all easy to transport, mainly because it is too large.\nThe weight, frankly speaking, is not a problem in this regard: the console alone with the Joy-Con (the side controllers) equipped it already weighs more than the dock alone... all that lithium in a plastic tablet, trust me, it looks like lead.\nThe dimensions, however, if apparently small (at least compared to an entire fixed-only console) are problematic if you want to bring the dock in a bag or backpack together with the console. All transportable cases, obviously, cannot reserve a space for the base, unless they are as large as briefcases.\nPausing for a moment with words in the wind, and talking about numbers, we are at 238x98x13 millimeters for the console (Joy-Con included), and 172x102x50 mm for the dock: in short, the latter it is almost 4 times as thick as the tablet, which is a problem.\nMy generic briefcase case (one of those quasi-padded ones, with space for accessories) is, when closed, 249x126x52 millimeters: if it also included space for the dock it would be a duffel bag!\nBeyond banal appearances And it is exactly like this, by carefully observing ever more minute details in order to produce refined deductions, that we remember something - at least, I and all those who learn do- yourself and programming from my blog (much wrong?): the over - engineering is a danger always around the corner, when you try to do something particular.\nClawed walls included! One of the design oversights that immediately emerged with the design of the base, and which would not have been present at all if only Nintendo had opted for a more essential design, is that the space in where the Switchtablet fits and rests is a little too tight. The two plastic faces are not so close that it feels strange when inserting or disconnecting the console, yet close enough to create scratches on the front of the console.\nTo be fair, no scratches can accumulate in the actual area of the display, but realistically only at its edges (and on the most extreme pixels of the display, and here's where it comes from collective anger), given that it is only in that area that the dock has 2 symmetrical protrusions, which act as guides for insertion.\nObviously, the front panel gets scratched only because it is made of plastic: if it had been made of glass, no accidents would have occurred. However, considering the breadth of the market target to which the console is aimed, and the rest of its technical characteristics, a glass display would actually have been inadequate. After all, anyone who cares can, as I did, buy glass film for a few euros, and apply it in an instant.\nReduced air flow Many games that run on Switch, in attempting to maintain an acceptable performance regime during the gameplay session, work to the detriment of temperatures, which rise by a lot (especially on the very first revision of the console, which features a more energy-intensive chip.1 ). Hence the need for the console to have an active cooling system, which sucks air from a small grill on the back, and then spits it back (hot) at the top.\nNot that I have much experience in fluid physics, but it seems to me, from the simple use of the console, that in dock the fans tend on average to always spin with more force than in portable mode, even with the same video resolution (720p) and, as a rule, CPU and GPU frequencies.\nIn fact, due to the way the tablet rests in its base, half of the rear grill faces the dock cable compartment, while the other half is directly obstructed (very close to a wall plastic). This first half, in addition to possibly being partially obstructed by power and video cables, receives air only from the two small open spaces (on the left and top) on the back of the dock; and to me, this air seems little.\nHere is a graphic model of holes, air flows, and possible cables. The situation with the small rear grill is ugly (in blue, and out of scale due to excess, now that I notice)!

Finally, the lack of a horizontal positioning mode for the base is a bit stressful, which would be particularly useful when space is limited\u003c /strong\u003e and the cables must be short ‚Äî as in gaming stations near the TV (a common situation in some Japanese homes, by the way), or even desk stations \u003e (my case).\nIf turned on its long side, in reality, the base remains there, and the console remains connected; but just pull something a little to make it slide out, and then disconnect.\nFor the record, both Wii and Wii U, as well as the competition consoles (the present ones, and several past ones), were designed to be able to rest in both orientations. It would have been convenient to have this option, although perhaps it's not the end of the world, compared to the other hassles: also because all you need to do is add a self-made triangular support ( or bought from sellers who deal with plastic craftsmanship) to have a more decent situation, in which the console remains a little inclined with respect to the support surface of the base ( and not almost parallel).\nPhoto from \u003c a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/877452299/nintendo-switch-dock-horizontal-base\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDVAMakerStudios, Etsy. What to do What can be done then if this plasticone is the cause of all these serious diseases? We said it above: using a generic USB hub, as on all normal devices, is not possible here.\nDock that the great uncle bought at the market... Mostly only on the Web, there are third-party Switch docks for sale, in all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, following the negative reports made by many users after a variable time of use, I do not consider them reliable at all (even if certainly some of the hundreds will be, but who knows which ones!).\nDue to the bizarre protocol according to which the energy is managed between Nintendo Switch and its official accessories, it seems that the console can break with third-party accessories that (also) provide charging. Which is bizarre, so to speak, because virtually any other device on the market with a USB charging port does not break, except with unorthodox and deliberate procedures, which beyond using a competitor's charger.\nOn Amazon in particular, however, you can also find other types, in addition to the clones made from scratch of the dock:\nThe compact ones that contain - or at least, so they say, but it seems so looking at the photos (the layout of the ports and the dimensions of the card, by eye, match) - the official card contained in the base produced by Nintendo (such as this one for ‚Ç¨24.99). The same thing just presented, same design, same dimensions, but without any integrated card (like this one for ‚Ç¨19.99): they are \u003c strong\u003edo-it-yourself kit, the idea is to take the card from the dock you already have and mount it in this new body. li\u003e ...and that was how his money burned. Whatever option you choose, it seems that you end up paying at least 20 hard euros just for bad plastic, screws, springs, and some other nonsense\u003c /strong\u003e. Even this, in terms of price, is simply excessive to say the least; it's too much, period. Everything is overcharged, and I bet that if one of the Chinese housewives in my shop sold at least one DIY kit, it would hardly cost more than 10 euros.\nOnly one option At the end of everything, then, I only have one option left: plastic, cardboard, glue, tape, pins, and elastics. This time too it's time for the do-it-yourself piece, the one at totally zero cost which I really like.\nThere's way too much to talk about, as usual, so that'll all be for the next article!

I got the card without repeating anything, so my parents didn\u0026rsquo;t waste money on that matter, but the experience was terrifying.\nThe classroom at these rounds was always packed, and this very thing ended up being a problem for my soul.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I deserve all this\u0026hellip;\nProblems in the air Last month I took 2 tests out of the 3 I was missing, and already nothing went smoothly, at all:\nMy professor (project contact) hadn\u0026rsquo;t told me that I should have received a private link in the email address of the school domain to create an account on the online exam platform\u0026hellip; Too bad I have access to email only on the Puppy Linux stick and on the tablet, and I can\u0026rsquo;t log in elsewhere2. Result: I had to rush home to get the tablet and go back to school\u0026hellip; Luckily I live nearby.\nThe testing platform totally broke when I finished one of the exams (not without difficulty, some questions were _[glitchate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch#Computer _glitch)_!): as soon as I started the second one, the system said that I had run out of time, and closed the test I had just started in my face. .. The prof. he had to waste time calling support to explain the matter, and after quite a mess the exam was reset as not taken.\nBetween both things, then, a good amount of time was wasted. And if that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been the case, maybe I would have** made it through all the exams that day.\nThe present Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to today.\nOnce the hassle of waiting was over (not too problematic, thanks to the rectangle of plastic, glass, metal, with Internet connection, and pocket book, which I also always carry around), due to the fact that all the stations were initially occupied, ** start**.\n\u0026hellip;But I had never done it!\nMy first few minutes go fine, until a good selection (random, or did destiny carefully choose them?) of **monkeys also start finishing the exam **, who from the rows behind everything were babbling with those who (I imagine in confidence) still hadn\u0026rsquo;t finished, at an exaggerated volume and at the same time.\nHere, now, slowly, the blood starts to boil in my body, as if it were a coffee pot, because with that mess I can\u0026rsquo;t read half of a question **without getting distracted ** totally. Even having earphones in my ears (but detached) didn\u0026rsquo;t attenuate the noise enough. Finish that way the exam? Impossible.\nI tried Before it was too late, I tried to call the teacher ‚Äî who, damn the badass, was pretty distracted, because another person at that moment had the same glitch happen of my previous time (and here I have to: what a shitty backend this platform has, throw it away and rewrite it from scratch, please!!!).\nI wanted to kindly tell him to keep all those who didn\u0026rsquo;t have the right to speak in silence, and after a few minutes (to his credit, of his own accord, a moment before he heard me) he babbled something (about unconvincing) to tell the audience to calm down. The audience did not quiet down, and the prof. he was going crazy due to the general problems, unfortunately, so little could he listen to me.\nThe last time there was less mess. Perhaps because there were fewer wrong individuals, perhaps because I was at the PC in the far corner of the room (which today was not turned on), perhaps because, given that there was an external commissioner, the rules could only be violated without making any noise. I do not know.\nI even decide to call my father, upon arriving here, to tell him to call the professor on the phone; maybe this time he can understand. In fact, this time the call for silence was more convincing. Was it?\nA disaster But, now, too late anyway: my tension has risen too much, I am unable to regain a minimum of concentration, forcing myself, after perhaps 21 good months in which I was able to do without it , scratching myself to convert a minimal part of the mental load (which requires major mental energy to be managed, the same that I needed at that moment to complete my session) into skin burning (which, up to a certain level, is managed by the brain in the background). What a drag.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve now done the damage, alas and what the fuck, and it seemed that everything was slowly calming down and concentration could return\u0026hellip; but no. The call of the prof. it was however too soft and didn\u0026rsquo;t put down the bad behaviors of that part of the other students, he just put them on hold a bit.\nThe real solution Dunno, at this point I simply feel like punching the desk and \u0026ldquo;screaming\u0026rdquo; (not that I know how to do it, but the punch is needed to make up for this; I unconsciously learned it from another professor of mine) to be quiet, because otherwise I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to accomplish anything, and\u0026hellip; it worked. Oh?\u0026hellip;\nYes, that\u0026rsquo;s all. I can\u0026rsquo;t say anything else about this moment, it immediately crystallized into goodness. From there, until I finished and could leave, not a fly flew again.\nAt that point, unfortunately, I had still accumulated the irritation, and it took me _hours and hours and hours to get rid of it**, between doing various things to case and writing this article.\nThe only thing I can logically regret is that I didn\u0026rsquo;t ring that bench a few precious minutes before seriously reaching the limit, since the gentle methods didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Unfortunately or fortunately, damn, it\u0026rsquo;s not a reflection that arises too often; only when I am already beyond that limit, and perhaps I have already committed other avoidable damage.\nYet, that doubt still remains: but what have I done that was so bad in the world to deserve these things? And let me understand\u0026hellip;\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References The certification\u0026hellip; oh God, even the latter, not that I personally care: on my deathbed I certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be **counting cards ** which I could have but didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get; mainly my parents convinced me, so whatever.

What real consequences will this bring to us ordinary citizens? Blocks (instant and per IP) The point that perhaps struck me most about the law (here the PDF examined by the Commission , and [the final report](https://temi.camera.it/leg19/dossier/OCD18-17872/disposizioni-contrasto-illecita-trasmissione-o-diffusione-diretta-e-della-fruizione-illegale-contenuti- protected-by-right-d.html)) - perhaps because I own various online properties, totally personal, which have zero economic value for me, but unquantifiable sentimental value - it is the obligation for the providers of Internet services to respond to instant block requests.\nA copyright holder can send a blackout request which, when it is urgent - think of a live sports match, which is being illegally rebroadcast in real time - must be honored in no later than 30 minutes by all providers, without any adversarial or formal process: it will be the owner of the blocked website who will then have to open legal proceedings for * dispute the block* and request reinstatement.\nFor illicit sites, all domain and subdomain names (DNS), and IP addresses, present and, I have no idea according to what limits, all possible future ones are blocked.\nThe new responsibilities By \u0026ldquo;suppliers\u0026rdquo; we do not mean only telephone operators, who provide the connection to the Internet, but in general those \u0026ldquo;involved in any capacity in the accessibility\u0026rdquo; of illegal services, and explicit reference is even made to ** search engines**.\nSearch engines do nothing other than return links accompanied by a description, and actually do not directly provide pirated material: in practice, this law even aims to hinder those who only provide links, not just those who allow the downloading of data physically.\nFor this logic, the managers of social networks will also be held responsible (and I imagine that \u0026ldquo;information society\u0026rdquo; in the text refers precisely to them), and possibly *small communities * online.\nAn expensive firewall The potential for abuse and errors is very high, and in fact, viewed impartially, this move can in any case be summarized as the obligation for ISPs to build a [mega-firewall] (https://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-mega-firewall-could-render-italian-isps-liable-for-over-blocking-230413/), for all intents and purposes under the control last of the State, with all the other problems that derive from it (even accidental).\nSooner or later an over-blocking incident will happen, and there will be problems with Web services that have nothing to do with piracy, if they start messing with IPv4 address blocks.\nIn any case, a big hit will probably be seen on everyone\u0026rsquo;s bill, even those who do not consume or share pirated material!\nCentralizing a network that has existed for decades, built from the beginning as decentralized, is a tough business, and other states that work to control information know this well.\nAn example can be given by comparing Russia and China: both states have a certain desire to control political dissent on the Internet, but:\nFor Russia it is difficult, as it has a more traditional Internet infrastructure, which began to develop as decentralized well before Putin\u0026rsquo;s arrival, when the present government was of another type. For China it is easier, because the government in office at the time (the Communist Party, like today), understood the potential of the Internet, and ensured that development took place **immediately ** according to a centralized scheme. It is therefore inevitable that raising this mega-wall-of-fire now, out of nothing_, will entail substantial costs, which however will be at the total expense of all of us consumers, instead of being at expenses of the billion-dollar entertainment multinationals (which will only be burdened by the costs of the unified state platform that will connect rights holders and ISPs).\nBut this last detail, rightly, does not matter to our parliamentarians and senators, who fortunately for many years have received respectively [1200 and 1650 ‚Ç¨ per year just for telephone costs](https://www.laleggepertutti.it/ 353259_how-much-do-parliamentarians-earn), thanks to those of us, idiot citizens, who pay taxes.\nHunting for users In addition to wanting to counter in a specific and now unequivocal way the \u0026ldquo;live broadcast\u0026rdquo; of duplicate content - something that is already generating discontent among those football fans with a *tight budget * - apart from the usual contents in general (audiovisual, press, or IT), the law expressly goes against end users, [at least a certain category](https://torrentfreak.com/ew- pirate-iptv-bill-moved-to-senate-as-italy-takes-on-digital-mafias-230324/).\nIn fact, fines of up to ‚Ç¨5000 are foreseen in case of repeat offenses, for those who (as far as I can understand, from reading the law and watching other people\u0026rsquo;s videos and articles), purchase subscriptions to paid pirate services, like the famous \u0026ldquo;pezzotti\u0026rdquo;, the illegal IPTV packets.\nAre some okay? All in all, despite the initial general fear and alarmism, it seems that the only users who have something to fear are precisely the latter, because - although it must be said that I know relatively little about the law, and it is not easy to apply generic understanding skills some text on legal bricks, so who knows - the text talks about buying or renting, and not even things like downloading for free.\nIf, therefore, up to now, surfing the Internet to find links to \u0026ldquo;crunchy\u0026rdquo; football matches, with pixels as big as biscuits and the habit of buffering, has never actually been prohibited, or download the tenth movie of the week via torrent, or even stock up on repackaged video games for free, one can well imagine that things will remain as they are in this sense.\n\u0026hellip;Maybe not at all Decidedly less calm moments could instead be experienced by those who participate in sharing copied content, even with a torrent left in seeding.\nIn Italy it seems that no single seeder has never been prosecuted, nor has their connection ever been blocked, but with the authorization to block of IP addresses the situation risks **changing , and perhaps from today ISPs will have to stop trashing lawyers\u0026rsquo; letters; if not the hundreds who arrive every day from the United States, with the presumption of wanting a US-only law to be respected in Europe (the DMCA), at least those few Italian annuals do (assuming they actually exist!).\nNot only the \u0026ldquo;digital mafia\u0026rdquo; will suffer Those who are worse off in this whole story are certainly the members of the \u0026ldquo;digital mafia\u0026rdquo; - as Massimiliano Capitanio, commissioner of [AGCOM] calls it(https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki /Autorit%C3%A0_per_le_garanzie_nelle_communications) - i.e. those who sell premium pirated packages, profiting: for them, fines of up to ‚Ç¨15.5m and prison of up to 3 years .\nPerhaps, if this new law targeted only them, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much to discuss: they have no passion for sharing, only that of *money *.\nPerhaps you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t object much even if, by going against the platforms that make certain links available, you considered acting only against those profit-making companies: Google, Microsoft (with Bing), Facebook, Twitter, and so on.\nBut in Italy they have already blown up TNTVillage, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want the decimation of all the other online squares created by the people for the people - non-profit, and indeed often wasteful, both in time and money - just because someone is annoyed by using the main functionality of the Web: hyperlinks, invented to encourage free sharing and free of culture and entertainment, without barriers.\n","date":"April 16, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2023-04-16-%EF%B8%8F-What-impact-will-the-new-Italian-anti-piracy-law-have/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nBetween 1 and 2 months ago - realize how much time passed before I got annoyed definitively - the batteries in the remote control of the television that I keep on my desk (I use it as a second monitor) have started to run out beyond the limitof tolerable usability.\nBecause I didn't do anything Up until now I haven't changed them, simply because I was getting annoyed and dry, considering that:\nI have relatively few rechargeable pen and mini-stylus batteries, and I have to save them for the stuff that really draws a lot. I don't want to waste non-rechargeable batteries and contribute to, in order: The waste of house money; The global waste of materials; The waste of energy for the transport - and, when possible, recycling - of these materials; Ultimately, the pollution of the planet. The batteries in the remote control still work, although in a decidedly not optimal way. Technically \"it works\" The remote control, in fact, proves that it can still send signals to the television, but only for a moment: just long enough to press \u003ea button, and nothing more. In an instant he then returns dead, and immediately trying to send other signals is of no use.\nIf, however, at this point you wait about fifteen seconds, and then you press another key, the command goes to sign. It is clear that the batteries are very discharged, but they still have that little charge that allows a capacitor to charge slowly, and therefore at remote control to be powered. Emitting the infrared light then apparently drains all the charge from the capacitor in a few moments, and then you have to wait again for it to recharge.\u003c /p\u003e What do I need it for on my desk? Honestly, I don't need the remote control anyway. 98% of the time I only use it to turn the appliance on or off; those very few other times when I need to adjust the volume, or change the active source, I can easily use my smartphone, on which I have an application that uses the emitter integrated infrared (that's right, producers don't integrate it only as a means of playing pranks in places open to the public, but also as a useful tool). For when I have to do it immediately! The problem, big problem, when I have to turn on and off, is that I need quick access.\nI can't start to unlock the phone, look for the application icon for the remote control, and then press firmly on the display to center the power button, all with easy pigs \u003e of my Android ROM, which is buggy and slow, as if it were from Ohio (instead it is from developers in India, like virtually all Android custom ROMs).\nThe controls on the back The TV has an integrated control interface: a simple wheel that moves in two directions and you press, and you can use to turn on/off or change source.\nThe problem is that it is in a terrifying position! It is practically on the side of the rear edge, the one formed by the continuation of the plastic structure, which holds the television circuitry, behind the LCD frame.\nPractically I would have to bend over every time, sticking my fingers between the annoying obstacles that live on my desk.\nMaybe I should be thankful that those controls are on the left edge - since I have the other screen immediately to the right, things could have been worse strong\u003e - and be satisfied... what balls... piles... no, balls!\nMy solution And so, for this outdated art attack, I take the following materials and tools:\nA pliers (absolutely not made for bending metals, but I have this), to bend: An old paper clip, of medium thickness. Scissors (with non-rounded tips), for cutting: The card of the Amazon packages. Double-sided tape. Hilarious process So here's what I went to do:\nI bend a terminal part of the paperclip to form a small ring. It serves to accommodate the protruding central part of the wheel. A little at a time, I take the measurements that the paperclip must have, and bend it accordingly: I place the paperclip on the wheel; I see how long it is at the first new detachment point it reaches on the TV body; I take it again, holding the point of interest with my finger, and patiently fold it; Repeat until the paper clip reaches the front edge of the television, passing over the side one. I notice that the protrusion of the wheel ends completely inside the ring, which therefore does not press it; then I fit a small piece of cardboard into the ring (optionally blocked with adhesive tape). In this way, something solid pushes exactly on the wheel, which is actually pressed. Since everything seems fine to me, I start cutting cardboard strips, and attaching some double-sided tape to the ends. These are to support the paperclip in different points, and not let it fall away from the button, but leaving it freedom of movement in one direction. About halfway I leave the strips clean, and crease them slightly, to leave a space in which to pass the metal wire; Keeping the paper clip in the right position, I attach the strips where necessary. (I couldn't take the less blurry photo back there, sorry.)\nWhat a job... As regards pressing the button - which I can now implement by placing my finger on the extreme left edge of the screen, without having to put my hands behind everything - this solution works perfectly.\nAlas, the rotation of the wheel is not good with this crotch, which has good freedom of movement on only one axis. In any case, the cardboard does not create excessive rigidity, so I can still rotate the wheel from behind.\nThat's it. If I were to improve my solution - which, yes, is very crude, I won't deny it because this is what I like - I will write an appendixto this article.\nAwkward questions I already know that the question will come, so I'll answer now:\nBut all those loose batteries you put in the cover photo?\nEhhh. Good question.\nThey are all batteries that I keep when they are discarded at home (not by me, since, I repeat, I avoid non-rechargeable ones as much as possible). , because very often \"discharged\" just means \"too discharged for the device from which it was replaced\". For some remote controls, in fact, they often still work, including mine in some cases.\nSo did I just waste time with today's project? Nah, I wouldn't say: from now I can easily keep the remote control a little more put away, no longer necessarily always on the desk strong\u003e, which I can therefore keep very lightly (because in an instant I ruin my own efforts!) more tidy.\n","date":"April 3, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2023-04-03-Everything-so-as-not-to-change-two-batteries.../","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

In a good way, obviously: complexity impresses and rewards those who seek it, but the title remains playable for anyone.\nAt first it\u0026rsquo;s making \u0026ldquo;houses\u0026rdquo; that are 4x4 holes under the ground, but later it becomes creating titanic installations, purely aesthetic or even totally functional - let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that Minecraft, with its redstone, is Turing-complete. And in the end? Well, it will never come to an end\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;WIP. For other information that is not totally subjective, for now there is Wikipedia.\nMy story I discovered Minecraft when I was maybe 7 years old, because another kid had it on his tablet at after school. I remember that he had built several large buildings, with decorations and everything. I was blown away practically instantly, because I had never seen any game that was remotely close to this one, even though at the time we were in the very first alpha versions of Minecraft Pocket Edition, which had very little content (less than Minecraft Java alpha!).\nIt was difficult to get the application, for reasons relating to my general use of Android at the time, but I finally managed to get it on my Galaxy Player, and then on my break-in tablet. At first I had the demo, needless to say it wasn\u0026rsquo;t good because progress couldn\u0026rsquo;t be saved upon exit, and so playing was pointless. Then, somehow that I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember, I managed to find the APK of the full version.\nFrom there, every hour of play was a new discovery, or a new self-imposed goal accomplished. I started building strange buildings that were difficult to navigate, with intricate passages, that if I wanted to do today I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even know where to start. Due to a whole series of events, I lost the worlds I had on the tablet (which were nothing special, in fact I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember them well), but those of the Galaxy Player are still there today. Here are some photos of what was my major at the time: https://pixelfed.uno/p/octo/299639948389257216.\nShortly afterwards I learned, thanks to an application that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember whether I discovered it by chance on Google Play or was recommended to me, of the existence of thematic maps created and shared by other players online. I lost some time on them, especially on the parkour ones: with the touch controls (and at the time no crouching!) they quickly became torture, but when you manage to make the difficult jumps and move forward it\u0026rsquo;s always nice.\nOn the PC I had at home at the time, there was no way to start Minecraft, for who knows what obscure reason; I imagine ancient video card and/or video drivers. At the end of 2014 I then tried to run it on what was at this point my new Windows tablet (still broken, but in different ways than the Android one), and somehow it started, but it ran too slow to be playable. Too bad I didn\u0026rsquo;t know at the time that I could try lowering the resolution or running an older version to get more performance. When 2 months later, now in 2015, the new PC arrived at home, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember why but I didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to run Minecraft. Sadness. At the end of the new year I then got the laptop, and I put Minecraft there, and I wore it out, sure enough I wore it out!\nI started there both playing offline and on some Italian servers. A few months later, when I bought a legitimate account of the game, I was also able to try globally renowned servers such as Hypixel, and others that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember now, because today they are totally irrelevant or possibly even dead!\nIt was on PC that I started seeing big things with redstone, because MCPE at the time was still in alpha and relatively barebones: a lot of elements were missing. Who knows where the hell I saved my first superflat world made there, with all the useless constructions and experiments! I should look it up.\nOnline, I immediately started testing minigames on servers: SkyWars, BedWars, Hunger Games, PvP FFA, a few minor non-violent ones. On BedWars at a certain point I end up spending so many hours in a row over the months that my performances actually become good and I often win the games, but if I tried to play it again now (and I tried again), I would realize how much rust I have accumulated.\nI then also gave a chance to multiplayer game options structured in the long term, and not as minigames in games: creative battles, classic survival, but above all SkyBlock, that was epic stuff.\nThen there were other things in between, between MCPE becoming Bedrock Edition, better in some things and (still) worse in others, time spent on Minecraft Console Edition (the old version before Bedrock supplanted it) with its minigames integrated which were really nice. When I got a new Nintendo 3DS XL in the summer of 2019, I started playing Minecraft on that too, which was more convenient for me than playing with touch controls on a smartphone (for when I\u0026rsquo;m on the move), and it continues to this day.\nNow there are alternating months in which I open Minecraft almost every day, and others (definitely more frequent) in which I completely forget that it exists. Almost 3 years ago SpaccCraft was born - the third edition, if we want to be honest towards those other two worlds in which we exaggerated a little too much and did literally smash, but basically we have to since \u0026ldquo;SpaccCraft\u0026rdquo; it comes right from there - and now that too has declined. The server works, but it runs practically empty, no one plays and I can\u0026rsquo;t complain too much about it, as first of all I don\u0026rsquo;t find the time to do it.\nTake a look at the SpaccCraft website, there\u0026rsquo;s a bit more concrete stuff to see, and a few ruminations about my whole life.\n","date":"April 1, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/miscellanea/raccolta-videogiochi/%EF%B8%8F-Minecraft/","section":"Miscellanyü™ÅÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Literally standing on the edge of the mirror, the edges of the enormous glass of which the buildings of La Citt√† are made, one runs and jumps without any brakes.\nThe parkour element of the game is extremely immersive; although I haven\u0026rsquo;t played the first game in the series for long enough, but only the second, Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge: Catalyst, I can talk about a magical experience about the latter. Perhaps thanks to the graphics, more realistic than the first game, certainly thanks to the controls, responsive but not excessively taxing, the pace of the game is naturally pressing.\nFor a title that can be enjoyed with standard equipment, not in virtual reality, the extent of this quality is decidedly impressive. Often while playing Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge I found myself in states of flow that were both refreshing and tense in which, without me thinking too much about it, I went in just a few seconds from anxiety due to exaggerated leaps of faith, in which it was as if my weight on the chair was canceled out making me feel like I was suspended in the air, to others of continuous running with low effort, almost as if Faith was moving alone and not by my hand.\nThe game cannot disappoint even those who, after a subjective analysis, might believe that such a formula could quickly become monotonous: Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge is not just platforming and parkour, but features hand-to-hand combat against human entities (practically the police who want to hinder runners). In the most suitable moments to break up the rhythm of the gameplay, you come across stakeouts that you have to deal with immediately, with dry and continuous moves: the less time you waste, and the sooner you continue on your path, the better.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a real shame that, with a very good probability, we will never see a third game be created for the saga, for reasons related to the trends of the video game market. Oh God, actually a third game already exists, Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge Mobile: it was released in 2011 (well before Catalyst) for iOS and Windows Phone, and perhaps I could try it with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Windows Phone emulator for Windows desktop, I would like to be able to play it on my Android smartphone, but for the moment this is not yet possible.\n","date":"April 1, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/miscellanea/raccolta-videogiochi/%EF%B8%8F-Mirrors-Edge/","section":"Miscellanyü™ÅÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nIn Minesweeper (in Italian officially \u0026ldquo;Minefield\u0026rdquo;) you have a game grid in which bombs have been randomly placed (by an algorithm).

So, aren\u0026rsquo;t you having just one more play?\nHowever, if you have lost the game, the need to immediately start a new one is compelling and difficult to ignore. If at this point you end the game, despite your desire, then there will be plenty of room for those thoughts that say how you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to play Minesweeper, and your time will never get shorter!\nThis is all absurd if you consider what stuff we\u0026rsquo;re talking about:\nAn overall bland puzzle, with essential controls, sparse graphics (even the slightly more elaborate implementations have a practical limit to the graphical improvements they can make), and simple logic.\nA program that was born 3 decades ago, together with Windows Solitaire, simply to teach people to use the mouse in a fun way.\nA game belonging to a distant era in which the concept of \u0026ldquo;gamification\u0026rdquo; was alien to everyone, and free-to-play video games were truly free: not built specifically to create addiction or pressure on players, as in-app purchases didn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nPersonally, I also call the minefield \u0026ldquo;minesweeper\u0026rdquo;, to joke about an incorrect pseudo-literal translation of the word \u0026ldquo;minesweeper\u0026rdquo; (literally but correctly \u0026ldquo;minesweeper \u0026ldquo;) in Italian. At certain moments, in an instant it becomes \u0026ldquo;minaspiazzante\u0026rdquo;, when it puts you in front of strange crossroads or intricate bomb placement schemes.\nBut, if these are all things that even a third party observer can notice, this apparently simple and office pastime hides much more. Minesweeper somehow manages to offer emotions that, again due to the objective circumstances, are difficult to communicate to the world.\nOnce you get the hang of it, after hundreds of games played and repeated over time, the moment of playing often becomes comparable to a meditative session capable of absorbing your soul. Only those who have made this puzzle their daily bread know the sensation: the hand is moved according to an overflowing flow of commands, imparted directly from an instinctive layer of the mind, often at a speed greater than that in which the conscious brain can register what the hell is happening; sometimes, after making the right moves in the heat of the situation (but never made at random), these are questioned by the conscious part of the mind about a fraction of a second later! - for no reason, because, again, correct.\nBy accumulating that single or double daily batch over the weeks, months, and years, you unconsciously learn to recognize all the mine placement patterns: the images of the numbered tiles - arranged exactly in a certain way, or another, of the dozens of possible - are imprinted in the mind and are then automatically fished out and analyzed the moment you are about to click. Hence some people claim to experience something similar to the \u0026ldquo;Tetris effect\u0026rdquo; with Minesweeper too: seeing patterns of numbered tiles in random semi-conscious situations (e.g., half-asleep).\nParaphrasing what [a PCGamesN author] writes (https://www.pcgamesn.com/minesweeper/get-free): Minesweeper is one of the purest forms of digital escapism that you can experience, because it is the practical demonstration of how a game, to be deeply immersive, does not have a vital need for a detailed open world, elaborate narrative, or characters to become attached to.\n...Sorry, there's work in progress on this page, I'm setting mines around to troll the next people who come here to read and they will stumble upon a few words... if in the meantime you want to learn how to play read [Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/Campo_minato_(videogioco)), go ahead...\nCuriosity In the 90s, even at Microsoft everyone was [obsessed with Minesweeper, especially Bill Gates](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped -lead-to-the-xbox). I would say that it is not difficult to see how\u0026hellip;\nIn 1999, following complaints from a certain Sergio Chiodo (??), who argued that the concept of the minefield game was offensive to the victims of real anti-personnel mines in the world, the International Campaign for the banning of Campo Minato. Microsoft partially buckled under the pressure, and in Windows Me and 2000 replaced the bombs in the game with flowers, and renamed the game \u0026ldquo;Meadow of Flowers\u0026rdquo;.1\nThe campaign only caught on to a limited extent outside Italy (?), and only with Windows Vista did the concept of the meadow of flowers game become global. Microsoft has given the possibility to change the game included in the system between mine theme and flower theme, a setting which has a different default value based on the country.2 Implementations For PC, the Microsoft original isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad. The Windows XP version works on the latest versions of the system, and even on Wine. Unfortunately, it scales a little poorly on high-resolution screens, as the squares are a fixed size and there is no zoom. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t been included in Windows for years, perhaps for this reason, but it can be downloaded from the Web:\nGlobal XP Version: Minesweeper.exe Italian XP version: Prato Fiorito.exe On Android, and I dare say in general, the best implementation I\u0026rsquo;ve found is Antimine.\nDownload from F-Droid: dev.lucanlm.antimine Source Code: antimine-android To play from Web browser, well, on this page I\u0026rsquo;m putting together something that for my personal tastes is the best available. It works well on both desktop and mobile (although the time you have to hold down a dial to plant a flag is long there), and has minimal graphics.\nI\u0026rsquo;m working on making the game customizable, for the moment you can only play with what I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented as a minigame to unlock reading the Curiosities section (if you don\u0026rsquo;t see anything, activate JavaScript!).\nNote: My implementation is based on vue-minesweeper, with some personal modifications for embedding. All my modified code is in the sitoctt repository (MIT license).\nSimilar and Clones Bullets, Minefield playable on paper.\nKaboom, a \u0026ldquo;cruel but honest\u0026rdquo; Minesweeper:\nThe placement of mines is not chosen once and for all at the beginning, but with each move. When you are in a situation of guessing (there are no adjacent cells proven to be safe), you have a 100% chance of surviving. When you don\u0026rsquo;t have to guess, and you do, the game chooses the worst possible outcome. The game with these rules develops in a new and interesting way, as you often find yourself in a situation where you have to think in a really tough way (at least, until you manage to unconsciously learn all the possible patterns: after months and months of usual matches).\nOther Resources Authoritative Minesweeper\nMinesweeper is one of the purest gaming experiences\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References https://tcrf.net/Minesweeper_(Windows,_1990)/en#Regional_Differences\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper#Windows_Vista_and_Windows_7\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"March 28, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/miscellanea/raccolta-videogiochi/Minesweeper/","section":"Miscellanyü™ÅÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Despite this, the two tools present obvious differences in their graphical interface.\nYou have to have both I generally keep both of these two programs installed, and I **use them in a rather alternate way, because:\nGPartedGNOME DisksGParted has fewer distinct functions, but everything has its place, and a sufficient level of depth strong\u003e and features: low-level disk information, formatting in tons of formats, and a few other details.GNOME Disks has less depth \u003e with individual operations, but offers some extra functions not strictly linked to the modification of partitions, which is always useful: energy and performance management of disks, an interface for the SMART protocol, and also a tool to test memory performance! It was a simple mission! The day before yesterday, when I booted a live USB Linux on [my laptop](https://sitoctt.octt.eu.org/Posts/2022-07-09-Come-ho-Riparato-il- my-Portatile-con-25-Euro.html), I had in mind to complete without damage a theoretically easy and painless mission:\nFree up space on the PC disk, deleting most of the files, except for those that I wanted to keep for a moment (to manage perhaps in the future). Resize the partition on the disk, as it will be quite empty at this point. Create a new partition large enough to install the new operating system on.1 Move files from the old partition to the new one, gradually shrinking the first and widening the second, until being able to delete the old. Too much mess. \u0026hellip;In practice, something went slightly wrong. It couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been a quiet evening! üòæ\nThis time, for the simple fact that when looking for a partition editor among the pre-installed apps of the live system in question, wanting to get it done straight away, the first program my eyes fell on was GNOME Disks . Oh, I should have stayed away. And there are many reasons:\n1. Physical disks are mixed with virtual partitions mounted from physical disks, in the list on the left of the window Already at this point, if (as in my case) you have strange type partitions, i.e. LVM, the situation becomes ugly, because it is not It\u0026rsquo;s clear where you have to go** to make changes.2\nGPartedGNOME Disks\u003c strong\u003eGParted only has a list of devices (real disks for sure, but I think also virtual devices) to select first, and then the large view with all the partitions for the chosen device. It is orderly and logical.On GNOME Disks, however, to do what you need to do, you go to disk view or where? In the first case there are some options and others are missing. Shall we try from the view dedicated to the virtual partition? Here too, the list of options is decidedly neutered, among other things both in the sense of quick icon buttons and in the sense of pop-up menu buttons... but now let's see what problems they have.\u003c/ tr\u003e 2. As appropriate, the quick icons available for each partition appear and disappear While on GParted, the list of icon-buttons at the top of the window never changes - rather the individual buttons darken or lighten, depending on whether they can be operated on the selection current or not - on GNOME Disks the hotkeys - indeed, positioned in a strange way too, stuck under the partition table area, which honestly I can\u0026rsquo;t even comment on - they appear or disappear completely . Below are the cases I have seen, but perhaps there are even more possible ones, who knows:\nOn the far left, for some selections you see a play/stop button (mount/unmount partition), other times in the exact same point there is a padlock (lock/unlock encrypted partition), other times a cross (creates partition in empty space), and in some cases nothing. Immediately to the right, a gear, button that opens a pop-up menu with a more complete list of options for the partition - we note that this ends up climbing to the far left, if before it there is nothing, just to confuse more. Finally, on the extreme right, in some cases a button with a dash on a red background (destroy partition) may appear. Ehh, this thing isn\u0026rsquo;t so good, because it makes it impossible to mentally associate a specific microzone of the window as dedicated to a specific operation. And this is potentially dangerous, if you take into account the big problem 5 (below).\n3. The options pop-up menu on a partition uses only text labels, never a single icon A seemingly small detail, but which is actually quite important. A text string allows you to unequivocally understand what a certain key does, unlike what can happen when you only have icons, but the best would be obtained by combining the two things: keys accompanied by icons.\nGPartedGNOME Disks\u003c td\u003eGParted does this for its contextual menus (at least on the most important items), and this allows you to immediately memorize the action corresponding to each option, and recall it immediately at a glance.Personally, using GNOME Disks I always find myself having to re-read a good part of the list to select something, although it is no longer than that of GParted, precisely because the icons are missing. 4. Hotkeys and pop-up menus are not alternatives to each other GPartedGNOME Disks On GParted you first have the task bar menu (of which various menus can also be recalled as contextual in some areas), which truly contains all the operations possible in the program; only the is there a bar with icons useful for quickly recalling the probably most common actions. In practice, as long as you have the menu bar, you can even forget about the existence of those little icons there.\u003c td\u003eWith GNOME Disks this is not possible. Actually, on several GTK3 apps it is like this: there are actions fixed to label-keys in a menu, and others fixed to icon-keys directly visible. Generally, however, those buttons do not disappear or partially appear when the state changes within the same application view! Maybe I have strange tastes, but this thing messes with my brain when using the software. To understand, just compare the buttons in this table to the contextual menu options seen in the one above!\nWhat have I done? All these factors together led to a huge patatrac! So, what do I do? I need to unmount the partition, before I can resize it.\nI go from disk view, and there is only the button for the options menu - plus what will come to mind only after when I will have already broken by now to break up , is the button to destroy the partition. In the list of options I read everything and I don\u0026rsquo;t even see an entry to unmount the partition. Meh.\nI go through the screen dedicated to that mounted partition, and I call up that menu again for I don\u0026rsquo;t know what reason, and rightly so I still can\u0026rsquo;t find anything. Next to the options menu button there was in theory the stop button, to unmount the partition, but it is clear that I really didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it**.\nI go back and forth between the two screens about ten times, and nothing, I\u0026rsquo;m really blind.\nAt a certain point, my unconscious gets bored of all this circling, and finally allows me to notice another button\u0026hellip; the dangerous red one. Ouch ouch. I press it and honestly I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember if I delete the confirmation dialogue once - which I was absolutely in no psychological condition to read - and then I press the button again for immediately afterwards confirm the dialogue, but one thing is clear:\nIf up until that moment I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think straight, because with every breath a rough \u0026ldquo;WTF?!\u0026rdquo; rang in my head, it was a matter of a few seconds from the moment of the fatal click because a bad feeling began to appear in my pierced, deformed head, full of expired peanuts\u0026hellip; üò∞Ô∏è\n\u0026hellip;Well, so what? What is it? \u0026hellip; Ohhhhah, okay, you win. I admit it: I hit too. Yes. Happy? In the end I moved the hand to click, of course\u0026hellip; But in my life I have done these operations many times! Even using GNOME Disks, sometimes among many! üò≠Ô∏è\nIn any case, no, I won\u0026rsquo;t put all the blame on poor Octt from three days ago. Now I play my trap card, and expose the real touch of misfortune without which I would probably have saved myself:\n5. Each action is performed when you request it, there is no queue I must admit that sometimes in GParted I have come close to tragedy** - but really tragedy, not like this time which, all things considered, I\u0026rsquo;m still experiencing. The difference, however, lies precisely in this little word: with GParted the disaster has always at most almost happened, but with GNOME Disks this time it has consumed and that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nOn GParted the operations you order end up in a queue, which must be manually applied once you decide to continue. And here too, we are down to the ** minutiae **, yet something like this weighs heavily on the final bill. We can see it like this: in that case, you have to make a mistake two (2) times to make a mess, while with the GNOME program one (1) mistake is enough.\n\u0026ldquo;Is there any damage?\u0026rdquo; In any case, I noticed that, after giving the order to delete the partition, it remained mountable, and the file system was all navigable. Probably, what Linux needed to use the partition remained in memory (RAM), and since all the data was never deleted with a simple quick deletion of a partition, it was all still readable.\nTo be honest, looking at the situation like this I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even realizing** the reality, I still didn\u0026rsquo;t understand whether my data had been condemned or not. .. Unclear interface, I said so.\nAs the feeling of rush passed and gave way to discomfort, I searched for GParted**, found that it\u0026rsquo;s included in the live system, and started it. Instead of the partition I see \u0026ldquo;empty space\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; oh yes, it\u0026rsquo;s done. But how come he let me delete the partition without** forcing me to unmount it first? What barbarism! GParted doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow this, for good reasons.\nYet, deep down, I still haven\u0026rsquo;t accepted that it was cancelled. I want to see if, after a reboot, it disappears permanently.\nAnd so it is, without even worrying about copying a shred of file - because it was about late and I had to get ready to go to sleep - that I restart. Oh yes, I see the GRUB black screen, and not the system booting! \u0026hellip;It\u0026rsquo;s all lost, there\u0026rsquo;s no point in going around it now.\n\u0026ldquo;After you did the damage did you think about restarting immediately without even saving the most important files?!?! But then you\u0026rsquo;re a certified bruh-idiot, twice, not once!\u0026rdquo; Ooooooooooooo, how dare you? How dare YOU be so right if the blog is MINE??\nThe only thing we can do now is the damage count. I have not lost unique and very important data, what I no longer have I should in theory be able to redownload or reconstruct. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about:\n40 GB of data exported from my old Google account; account that I planned to delete, but I hadn\u0026rsquo;t finished transferring everything and so I think it\u0026rsquo;s all still in the cloud.\nVarious large and small files downloaded from the Web, possibly some hard to find, but nothing vital.\nSource codes changed; we\u0026rsquo;re talking about porting attempts for obscure platforms that I tried and failed, or other very forgettable experiments.\nDumps of disks that I still have at home (some already uploaded to Archive.org), or additional copies of other data.\nDocuments whose current relevance is nil.\nIf I forgot something important in this list, however, maybe maybe it wasn\u0026rsquo;t important, and we can rest assured. Otherwise I would remember, right? Well, knowing me\u0026hellip;\nAvoid\u0026hellip; The moral of this bad story can be condensed into:\nAvoid GNOME Disks. Be careful when dealing with partitions, even if you have done it 50 times in the past. Avoid, absolutely, GNOME Disks! And I close with a advice, or rather, a development philosophy, that all those who design UI (even I, in my things, don\u0026rsquo;t hide it) forget too often: The user is drunk.\nSo, greetings. For the future I hope not to lose data in a stupid way (to you, and to me!). üëã\nP.S: The Linux distribution I installed this time is Pop!_OS. I really wanted to try it, but on 2 occasions I tried to install it on the desktop PC and it always gave an error. Here on the laptop it worked, wow, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a broken distro! (Maybe üëÄ)\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References The system I had up to that point, Linux Mint, version 19.3, after 3 years: It has become stale:Version 19.3 is discontinued, and the repositories no longer receive new software. So, I should have upgraded to the current version of Mint, but apparently I should have anyway done it by reinstalling from scratch (on apt dist-upgrade there are no new updates)It's broken:Some things (like broken video drivers, and the desktop environment that only starts in fallback mode) are definitely my fault (I screwed up with the drivers ACCIDIA in recent weeks), but others (Bluetooth no longer working!?) I would say no :/. In any case, when the system is so broken, it's quicker to reinstall everything... ‚Ü©\nMaybe yes, I\u0026rsquo;m an idiot, but not to the point of voluntarily setting up the partitions with a structure that\u0026rsquo;s alien to me. At the time, very simply, I installed Linux Mint with the default guided settings. Whenever I installed Linux I used manual partitioning, instead of choosing to erase the entire disk and let the installation program decide things, I instead always created normal partitions. So\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t blame me, [kthx](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/kthx#:%7E:text=(Internet%20slang)%20Abbreviation %20of%20okay%2C%20thanks.)?¬†‚Ü© ","date":"March 18, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2023-03-18-Ugly-interface-Files-all-destroyed/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nUntil now 2 months ago, my kingdom of Rasperino was at its maximum splendor: the Misskey instance, set up just 2 weeks earlier, \u003c strong\u003eit was going great, and now (almost) everything seemed destined to continue well...\nAnd instead, problems arose. Let's say it took me a little while to notice, because they developed in a strangely gradual way.\nThe initial cracks I noticed the first truly strange thing towards the beginning of December, when I realized that the system could crash by trying to perform a very banal operation but \u003c strong\u003especification: create a large archive of files (compressed or not)... with any program.\nThis small inconvenience has, in turn, caused a secondary problem... I'll get there.\nHowever, I didn't pay too much attention to it. How could I? The rest, if left untouched, worked, apart from some slight performance degradation due to Misskey's own work.\nThe first collapse But then, those other 2 weeks of relative peace passed, and I wake up with the server crashed, and which dies badly after any of my manual restarts (unplugging and replugging the power supply, it's the only way). After 2 days of very messy searching I didn't have I absolutely understood what the general cause of the problem was, but only the most serious symptom, and by now I was almost convinced that in some mystical way \u003e Misskey alone managed to take down the entire server, which instead went back to working properly without that particular software running. Well, there was some logic in my reasoning, given that in any case the average use of CPU and RAM was high (even if it didn't completely saturate). In the following days, however, with a few tests I discovered that the server was not crashing due to the microblogging server, but due to what it acts as a database\u003c /strong\u003e: PostgreSQL (in Docker). If I ran Misskey on my PC, but let it connect to the database on the Raspino, within a few seconds, with the arrival of so many notes, the fruity server died.\nBy now, in any case, the need to install something else was clear to me, because I was convinced that Misskey was too heavy, and never mind.\nFor 2 days I tried Epicyon, a platform that was particular to say the least... and the experience was not exactly pleasant, but I think was complete, given that I squeezed out four thousand words in my dedicated article. Immediately afterwards I decided to give a try to another software that I had never seen before, namely GoToSocial. With the latter, despite it being declared alpha quality (and in fact it has some problems), I found myself - because alas now it's all over... I'm getting there, I'm getting there - very good, but that's not the point .\nIncreasingly suspicious problems Just a few days later, those strange crashes started appearing again, but this time they were decidedly suspicious, because the general use of resources of the system was low. I tried to read the system logs in a productive way, but my patience had now reached the limit, and with it my lucidity , so every day I looked for the slightest suspicious but legible error, fixating on that and completely ignoring the illegible error that was always in front of me.\nBy now, just out of desperation, but not because I understood through reasoning that that was the problem, I decide to change the microSD card, and Now that I've done it, I bitterly regret... not having tried before! That was the problem, reckless Maremma!\nThe good thing is that the day before I had done a check of the file systems (ext4), both of the card and of my USB HDD, and everything had come out (approximately) clean, so I had excluded hardware problems a priori: \"if the files are not corrupt...\" I thought.\nAt about the same time (fate decided that help had to arrive late!), however, a person gave me a hand to understand what the hell those indecipherable lines, which were something like, were saying. ..\nDec 27 06:32:35 kernel: [27230.964650] INFO: task kworker/2:0:21874 blocked for more than 860 seconds.

The only thing that kept working is the constant spitting of this exact type of error in the log file.\nNow, I know that I'm strong, but with all these strange numbers in the way I absolutely couldn't see words like mmc_get_card code\u003e or mmc_sd_detect! And so I really didn't understand that maybe, just maybe, the microSD cagona that I had chosen for Raspi at the beginning of September (among those free at home), when I put this poor little computer back to work as a server, it was tending to die.\nI don't want to have to resort to commonplaces, but this time there's little to be done! I mean, the photo speaks for itself:\nThe presence of a renowned brand is not a guarantee of quality, but the absence of a brand is certainly a promise of absent quality.\nAlthough on the PC the old junk card still seems to work - I was able to confirm this because at least I was able to make a data dump - I don't want to no longer have to deal withstuff like this! I note it in my mind as badly, therefore.\nEven more time was then wasted in flashing the dump onto a new card, given that the only other two cards I had available at the time were 4 and 32 GB respectively, and I really wanted to put (after deleting various logs and caches, because the previous memory was 8 GB) everything on the 4 GB one, but nothing could be done; and in the end 32 GB was.\nThe peace violated The important thing is that, I put the new SD in the raspberry server, those terrifying errors no longer occurred, and the big problems they disappeared... or at least so I thought, I wanted, I hoped.\nIf this article, which should have literally been published at the end of last year, is only being published now, there are reasons. Immediately after I had changed the SD card, I preferred to wait a few days, to see if things had really calmed down, and to avoid claiming victory too soon. I did well!\nThe suffering disk Alas, in fact, those other things seen in the logs in the past few days were not huge holes in the water (still troubled), in particular the errors that I immediately recognized related to the USB disk.\nThis is something that already happened to me in the past with another USB adapter for 2.5\" SATA disks, even on different machines (in the period in which I used my Nintendo Switch console as a server...), but with this one that I use now there had never been any problems. And yet now, as far as I can see, it disconnects from the host randomly, doing dieall those processes that depend on the files that are on that disk, as if suddenly there were moments in which any combination of SATA adapters and USB cables does not receive enough power (both short and long), the disk still works great on PC, so the problem is clearly the Raspino \u003e... but go and understand why!\nThey tell me that the Raspi's USB-A ports suck by nature[citation required (?)], but the point is which until recently worked (all 4)! Has a diode broken in my power supply? That on the board of this damned single board computer, a capacitor has blown up? That the electricity in my house is no longer 230V, but 229V, and therefore the transformer instead of giving 5 volts in output gives 4.98? ...But what do I know.\nReturning to the real world, the only sensible hypothesis seems to me to be this: by inserting and disconnecting the power connector in its port (micro USB-B 2.0, that big shit!!!) , the pins on one side or the pads on the other will have worn out, so their contact surface is smaller, so the electrical resistance is greater, and therefore the device is powered with a slightly lower voltage, and when a peripheral needs to absorb a lot, here are the patatracs.\nTo try to resolve Not having another Raspone like it, and not having other 5V 3A power supplies, I will never discover the truth, but the solution in somehow I have to find it by force.\nAfter waiting so long that the server problems have only become bigger, and the downtime much more frequent, I decide to buy a USB-A-Y cable. At worst, even if you haven't solved the problem, it's always convenient to have a cable of this type because - despite infringing USB standards 1- some devices cause a lot of trouble without it, and some manufacturers of shitty peripherals even recommend using cables of this type in case of problems (and however, they proceed to not include one in the package, indecent!).\nOnce the cable arrives, I arrange all the connections and I notice something particular: the current that comes from the second USB power supply to power the disk, can strong\u003e go up the cable until it re-enters the Pi. The problem is not so much the cable, which works and respects all the laws of physics (even if not those of the USB standard), but more the fact that the Raspberry doesn't even have, I don't know, diodes in the USB-A ports. And it's a problem that I'm not discovering, just read on the official forum . In any case, to have a circuit set up like this:\nThere are no risks for the instrumentation or the surrounding environment if you use proper power supplies upstream, and mine should be2; Practical problems there are, but also solutions and arrangements: I could, as they suggest on the forum, apply insulating tape on the +5V pad of the USB connector that goes at Raspantino; but for now there has been no real need, the only thing I have to pay attention to is that things are powered in this order, those few times when I find myself having to do a hard reset of the system: USB disk (connected to the Y cable port); Raspi (from its power port); After waiting at least ~10 seconds, disk connected to the Raspberry (data connector of the Y cable connected to the Raspberry). I don't know why, especially considering that it is not needed for soft reboots, but without this procedure the boot can fail.\nFinally, rest In the end, however, hell seems to be over, and the server is now working.\u003c br\u003e The flames did some damage, however: the databases of many of my hosted services became corrupt, and of 2 in particular (GoToSocial, which I mentioned before, and Peka, a chatbot based on a Markov chain) I have backups that are too old (from weeks ago) because, with the server dying, my backup scripts never managed to work... and therefore these programs are still offline now, because I haven't yet had the strength to resign myself to restoring the ancient backups.\nBut I buy the cable a little earlier, and turn off the server while waiting, not really, eh?\nHoping that things like this won't happen again in the short future, otherwise I will go completely and irrecoverably crazy because of these damned hardware problems, I greet you and wish you never have to damn as much as I do. üòî\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References It was a surprise to me too, but the USB standard prohibits Y cables: see Update 72; translated into English,\nThe use of a \"Y\" cable (a cable with two A connectors) is prohibited on any USB device. If a USB peripheral requires more power than that allowed by the USB specification for which it was designed, it must be self-powered. Well, how nice are the rules, but then comes reality and the think a little differently. The whole real world uses Y cables without getting too much fuss.¬†‚Ü©\n(Both 5V) For the Pi, a 3A power supply (just above the suggested by Raspberry Foundation) which was included in a kit (excluding computer) of accessories for the Raspante, by Aukru. Oh well, after years it didn't explode, then the reviews were good anyway, and still this brand sells new power supplies, so it's fine...For additional power, a 1A block that was included in the package of my old low-end Huawei phone (also marketed in Europe), from 2017.¬†‚Ü©\n","date":"January 28, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2023-01-28-When-hardware-problems-become-mental-damn-Raspino/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Alas, fate still wanted to mistreat me, deciding to let everything end in a big fiasco (with a small tasting one first).\nWithout going into too much detail - anyone who thinks they want to know can read my complaints about Mastodon in the days of Thursday 1 and Tuesday 13 (√® clearly not a coincidence...) (but the good discussion started 2 days after) of this December, or wait for an article that maybe I will write - from the fateful day until December 19th I was again without an instance my my mine.

Eh eh, what...\nA look at Epicyon Epicyon I discovered it weeks ago, totally by chance, while I was looking for something, I don't remember what , on the Web.\nThat list of plus points that appears on the main page of the site immediately catches my attention: a technology stack that isn't flashy or used only because it's trendy, with little complexity strong\u003e server side (and therefore requiring few resources there), even with zero client-side JavaScript (so the application weighs virtually nothing), suitable for installation on single-board computer, also designed for browser with terminal interface... the premises were good \u003e.\nThe advantages of low-scale technology were immediately showcased by this little program: the installation amounted to installing some dependencies from apt, downloading the sources from the repository, and creating the configurations for the reverse proxy (Nginx) and the boot system (systemd).\nAbsolutely zero problems along the way; the trouble, in fact, came later!\nI created my accounts - first the \"sysadmin\" one, which holds the administration permissions and which I use to write as an instance administrator, and then the personal one - as I begin to orient myself in the application, several minor problems become aware of my presence and, like spirits, one at a time begin to manifest.\nThe user interface Let's start with theinterface, which is the first thing you deal with when using any application; well, it's really strange!\nOnce you learn it it's not difficult, but it has certain things that seem designed to cause confusion.\nOn your profile page you click the banner (which wastes space, I feel like saying, compared to a small button) at the top of the home page.\nOnly from the profile page can you then open the settings of the account, which are mixed with those of instance administration without a clear division.1\nOn the main screen not all subsections (including specific views for message flows) are visible, you need to click a button to show all the buttons.\nQuestionable choices.\nThis doesn't seem to be the intent at all, but I like to think that this is a point in favor, because it performs an artificial selection of the users: those Twitter refugees, who months ago (now the situation has calmed down) arrived on Mastodon to behave badly - publishing public messages like \"ooo but how the fuck do you use this thing?\", or \" what a shitty social network, you don't understand shit\", and I won't report anything else - they won't seek refuge even by mistake from what is \"more than a dog\" (this is the etymology of the name of the platform, according to Wikipedia).\nGraphic customization One of the things I was looking for most in the settings was the theme configuration.\nInitially I only found the color customization and text size options of the applied theme, but luckily that wasn't all: it was a bit hidden, but in the end I found the option to switch to a completely different template.\nIn fact, I didn't like the default theme very much, but I found some nice ones among those others already included. My favorite is called \"Pixel\", and offers a view that appears relaxing to me, with its backgrounds of a pseudo violet -lavender (#9ba0d4) and the text shown with a particular font \u003e, with characters made up of small squares put together (indeed, to simulate clearly visible pixels). The effect it has is interesting, because it is evidently a theme that cannot be classified either as light or dark; exists in its category. Or perhaps it can be defined as light, because the text is black, then the background is necessarily light by contrast. Oh well, I don't care: the fundamental point is that, for me, it's really beautiful.\n","date":"December 26, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-12-26-u200d-Epicyon-Fediverse-platform-lasting-2-days/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

I would say that it is time to start the necessary procedure of thawing the Padoru.\n...No, wait a minute. IT'S ALREADY MID DECEMBER?!?!?! üòê üò∂ ü§Ø\nThe months pass quickly... oh well.\nWhat is \"Padoru\" For many a controversial issue and a despised custom, that of the Padoru.\nFor those 3 people who live under the stones (and who I don't know how they could be reading this blog now, but I'll ignore it): it's a meme which, according to \u003c a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/padoru\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKnow Your Meme, born from a video game, Fate/EXTRA.\nIn a game scene, Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (I'm not joking) wears a Santa Claus costume, and dances in I walk around what I think is a corridor, singing an original parody of Jingle Bells, just 4 verses long.\n\u0026lt;video class=\u0026ldquo;SmallVideoQuote Blockquote NoImgCenter\u0026rdquo; title=\u0026ldquo;The video of the game scene.\u0026rdquo; src=\u0026ldquo;http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Padoru/PadoruPadoru.webm\u0026rdquo; [:videoelemargs-controlmuteloopauto:]=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;The video of the game scene.\nHASHIRE SORI YO\nKAZE NO YOU NI\nTSUKIMIHARA WO\nPADORU PADORU\nI tried to look up the meaning of the little song, but I did not have satisfactory results.\nThe only thing I know is that the last verse (from which the popular name of the meme derives), \"padoru padoru\", is the Japanese equivalent of the Italian \"cloppete cloppete\", the onomatopoeia of the sound of the reindeer's hooves. I don't know how this is possible but, honestly, it's the least strange detail.\nInternet customs Online, various traditions have developed around this meme for several years.\nThe most banal are the excessive re-sharing of the original video or its GIF images, or the production and sharing of original memes that refer to the initial concept.\nThen, people began to deprecate the expression \"Christmas season\", in favor of a more magical \"Padoru season\" - which is not really a replacement term 1:1, because it can also indicate the weeks a moment before perhaps those of Advent, those of November that I mentioned at the beginning and in which we are already starting with the Padoru guerrilla war on the communication platforms. The most beautiful custom (due to its passive-aggressiveness), according to my tastes, is to change the photos of one's various profiles with the image of a Padoru.\nThere are people who use their shared sense of humor to implement this thing as a (very relatively) mass operation. Then there are those who observe the phenomenon but are not aware of the meaning, do not understand, get angry, and are confused to the point of hitting themselves; or, who knows him perfectly, and gets even more angry because, well, maybe he despises Christmas.\nIf you are reading carefully, you will have noticed that I have just used, not surprisingly, the indefinite article... If you haven't noticed, you are getting distracted, and therefore , as punishment for your good, now I must necessarily force you to sing the above song out loud 3 times üë∫.\nHigh customization An important factor that has allowed this meme to become the phenomenon it is can be seen in its being extremely customizable.\nI don't know when this trend started, but at a certain point there were those who saw that the Padoru, Nero's original drawing in the video sequence that sparked it all, it's really simple to remix.\nIf you look at it with absent or at least down-to-earth inventiveness, you realize that you can change the colors in the blink of an eye with others that can equally look good, and It almost has a new design.\nHowever, those who have a minimum of creativity can without difficulty try to modify some of the shapes of the character, changing the right here and there to reconstruct a totally different character - whether original, or already existing but only drawn with other styles - in the form of that smiling little thing who runs around breaking up with his festive verse. This stuff is so extremely easy that even I, who normally if I try to draw anything artistic (or at least not very technical) create real glitches \u003e, I was able to create my very personal Padoru without any suffering.\nIn just 2 very scant hours, one morning on December 1st at school - I don't remember if it was a day of assembly or of various substitutes - a little tracing the basic lines of the Padoru aspect, a little introducing original features (which I derived from my 3D character, the one that appears in some of my profile photos throughout the year), with a generic drawing app on my smartphone I did what I felt I had to do .\nThe result was that, simply, something normal emerged; no horror! Very good. \u003c/ a\u003e\nMy \"participations\" Last year I created my Padoru specifically to use it as a profile photo (on Telegram), and I did.\nThe year before I had used one that wasn't mine, modeled on the kitsune Senko-san, and the previous year I had posted other types of Padoru memes.\nThis year I haven't done a whole lot of anything... and the peculiar thing is that I don't know how to explain it. Zero. üò∂\nWhat I suspect is that, simply, I forget üíÄ (I forgot about it üíÄ). 2 weeks ago I unfortunately had too many things on my mind: first my Misskey instance malfunctions and I have to run, then the fixation with ChatGPT, it's clear that there was really no way to reserve 30 seconds of time to update the photo of not even a single one of my online accounts.\nAt this point, I don't know whether to make the change now and therefore take advantage of all the time remaining until the end of the Christmas period to be Padoruante, or follow a minimal logic and wait the beginning of next week: the last week of Advent and the first of the holidays, it would make sense.\nLast year I may have gone all out with digital photos, but the physical side was accidentally neglected by me.\nLet's go in order.\nAll my parents actually put up the generic Christmas decorations at home - my mother in particular, who also has power to vetoon any overly progressive proposals regarding the large Christmas tree - in the first days of December.\nAmong the things that are taken back from the attic every year, there is also a small desk tree which is practically mine. It has integrated lights, powered by AA batteries, but in itself it is nothing too special. Or rather, that's how it was before I revolutionized it, 3 years ago (it was 2019!).\nModify the tree I think the flash of genius came after seeing a photo on the Internet, which depicted a Christmas tree (of normal size) with attached to a pair of paper pads; exactly like other types of decorations that hang, but less socially acceptable.\nThe idea had now taken possession of me, and at this point I had to recreate the same thing myself. I opened what was my trusted web search engine at the time, and searched for \"padorus images\" (or something like that), to create an assorted set of some of those little drawings, downloading the ones that caught my attention and I liked aesthetically the most.\nAt that moment I had a choice in front of me: do I print them big enough and put them on the big tree, or do I print them small to be able to put them on the tree? little tree?\nTo be honest, it wasn't a question of choice, as the first option was automatically to be thrown away due to my mother's veto, but the second option certainly intrigued me: the The little tree was (and is) in my room, so its normality would be completely wasted without some creative embellishment.\nOnce the print was done, all that remained for me was to cut out, more or less roughly (nevertheless, a good amount of work was strangely needed), the various Padoru, to then attach them to the tree with a little hot glue.\nIt turned out what I wanted, so I appreciated the work and took a photo to set it as my profile picture. The following year, the tree remained as it was.\nIn the present As regards this year, once I finally mentally entered the Padorizia atmosphere, contemplating that object that has been there for days on my bedside table, I thought it was a bit empty, and needed other Padoru.\nThe other day I thought that I should then look for some new ones online to print them, but a moment later it comes back to me a folder, which I found last month on my PC while I was cleaning.\nIt contains my original Padoru, and various others that I remembered having downloaded, but that I wasn't too sure I had \u003e never printed. The files are all dated December 2021, which is obvious for the only one I created, but actually curious for the others, if you consider the whole scenario.\nEven more curiously, one of the files present there is an image, with an aspect ratio equal to that of an A4 sheet, where all the individual images in the folder are arranged.\u003c a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn1\"\u003e1\n\"I will have composed it last year and in the end perhaps I will never have printed it again\", I think; and yet, something else in my mind tells me that I actually printed it all right, and maybe I simply never used it in the end. Surely, I have never attached those Padoru to the tree, because there are only those from 3 years ago.\nFor less than a quarter of an hour I searched for this unfortunate sheet in my room but, not finding it, I decided to reprint it. Oh God, I actually found a paper by Padoru... more or less: I found a fragment of the paper from 2019, with 3 images that I never used at the time.\nWithout wasting any more time, I send the document to the home printer, which promptly gives me back... a blank sheet of paper? It looked like it, but then I picked it up and noticed that it had been printed. The image? NO! A STAIN! ü§¨\nImmediately, anger takes over, but a second later it is overcome by an even stronger sensation: one of \"already seen\". p\u003e ...A little earlier At this point, something comes back to me, and I open the history of my Telegram channel (which I use as a micro-microblog) to look for answers to my suspicions : well, I printed these images last year. Now I remembered well!\nThe exact same problem had happened with the print going to hell which, strangely, occurs on 2 different printers, only by sending to print via the official application of Epson (printer manufacturer) for Android, and only for this image (PNG 2480x3472 of 9 MB), among all the ones I have had to print in my life.\nFor the first time I wasted time with my father - who had previously used the printer without any particular problems - first changing a cartridge marked empty, then cleaning the heads; after I don't know how many wasted minutes, on the third attempt to print I did it from my father's Windows PC, and the image finally came out. üò∂u200düå´Ô∏èüî™\nThis time however, as soon as I connected all the dots for a moment, I immediately tried again from the PC...\nIs it seriously too much to expect the official app to work as it should, or at least give an error, which it never gave me, if for some reason it can't handle a file correctly? I should send to hell once and for all these rotten, smelly proprietary printers straight out of hell, and build my own: with a microcontroller, servomotors, and of markers, as wiser people have already have done.\nAnyway, my intention, that distant day, was to troll2\u003c/ a\u003e my mother: print some new Padoru, all different and coloured, to attach them to the large Christmas tree, which that year it had been decorated by her with decorations categorically tending towards white.\nIn short, I printed all those there, but I only put 1 in number on the tree (among other things, it seems like 2 days passed before my mother noticed üòÇ), so it's clear that \u003c strong\u003eI plannedto do something with those others. I probably would have liked to put them on the mini-tree, but (yet, evidently) I never did it. Did I forger (üíÄ)? Very likely: these last December were also somewhat busy weeks, but I made January arrive (time to refreeze Christmas and all the decorations, Padoru and otherwise) without do nothing, then the thing will have just slipped my mind.\nConcrete conclusion Between yesterday and the day before yesterday, I first cut out a good part of the Padoru; not all of them, because otherwise I really spend hours on them, and because there won't be any left on my desk tree. ü§∑u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\nThis time I used the scissors in a truly painstaking manner, and I outlined the figures with a very high definition; by my shredding standards of drawings that have a lot of fine details of complex shapes, at least, it is.\nAfter this task - which would also be relaxing, if I didn't have to stare bend3 because of the light - with the hot glue gun, little by little (which still requires much less time than cutting) I glued all the figurines to the external leaf walls of the tree. I took the advantage of it to fix the elements stuck together 3 years ago, which were holding up but not very solidly... I probably did the job badly, \u003c strong\u003eat the time.\nThis here is the result, I really like it a lot.\nAside from the beauty of the object on a level that is personal for me, and having realized how it could - just in my eyes - become more beautiful, if it had become even newer and less standard, the high stakes of writing an article here worked miracles: it made me strong\u003ecompletea very simple manual activity, practically kindergarten-level do-it-yourself, without my brain canceling it after half a day !\nTo conclude, in essence we can - not ironically - say that it took an entire year for me to finally manage to attach a satisfactory quantity of small Padoru to my little tree.\nThe day before yesterday I started writing this article, believing that I would simply talk about how the idea originated for me and what I did to expand it in these two days, but then I rediscovered these details which are directly intertwined with the \u003c strong\u003elast year... wonderful. I think the story actually became more interesting to tell, after these misadventures due to the questionable functioning of my brain. üè∑Ô∏è Notes and References Update of 2022-12-24: I uploaded some more photos about the story on Pixelfed: pixelfed.uno/p/octo/512223099419845225. On the channel I found the ImageMagick command that I used to create the large image containing all the others arranged in a grid, I put it here for those who need to print things of this type: (to be done in the folder with all the images to be included) montage - define png:size=496x496 -geometry 496x496 -tile 5x7 -auto-orient * OUTPUT.png. The values of \"496x496\" and \"5x7\" can be modified as desired, here they are placed so that the resulting file will have dimensions very close to those of A4, with 35 maximum images on a single sheet, all equally scaled and squared. Perhaps the final image should be printed by adding good margins first, otherwise it risks coming out slightly cropped.¬†‚Ü©\ntrolling: In this case, playing a harmless prank.¬†‚Ü©\nstare bend: \"to bend\" in English means \"to bend\". I use the deliberately incorrect expression \"stare bend\" to mean \"stare bent\" (with your back or neck). It's a stupid meme of mine that was born under curious circumstances, maybe one day I'll explain it.¬†‚Ü©\n","date":"December 17, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-12-17-Christmas-distractions-the-Padoru-tree/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using Standard Notes as my personal notes app for a long time now.\nYears ago I chose it for its being free and open-source, but at the same time very clean, tidy, and functional. It was a perfect fit at a time when I was looking for something that supported data encryption that works, without affecting usability.\nWithout going into detail about why I liked continuing to use it, then I stopped, and then I started again until now, we need to delve deeper into one of its integrated functions in particular: [Listed](https:/ /listed.to).\nIt is a blogging platform designed by the same developers as Standard Notes, and available for self-hosting or free use on the official instance. Although I have never really used it before, I found the concept and its application interesting from the beginning.\nA quick need A few days ago, however, I started playing around with ChatGPT. This is a totally different question, yes, but it\u0026rsquo;s relevant because I asked myself a question: all these conversations I\u0026rsquo;m having with artificial intelligence, where can I put them to keep them integral, organised, findable and accessible to anyone, and for me easy to load?\nThe choice was about to use staticoso, my static site generator that I already use for the [sitoctt](https: //sitoctt.octt.eu.org), but then I thought better of it.\nI thought that, in fact, I want to actually make my collection of experiences findable on the Web. The problem here, however, which I have been able to bitterly observe in all these months, is how my site, for example, is, so to speak. .. Search engines don\u0026rsquo;t give a shit. üò≠\nBesides this being a separate topic, it should be noted that the blame for the horrendous fate of my site does not depend on its code; It\u0026rsquo;s the fault of the domain and/or the host. So, no, I will never abandon my static one: just changing the generator (and consequently the templates) with a more serious one wouldn\u0026rsquo;t solve any problem.\nIn short, I had to totally trash the idea ofhosting on GitHub and GitLab, and think about something else.\nBlogger from Google? The editorial experience leaves something to be desired on mobile. WordPress? It would be OK, but we know what could happen in many years to data inserted into a complex system; and WordPress is very complex. I struggled to find a little program that converts its backup XML into Markdown files\u0026hellip; which will most likely break in a few years, being unofficial, as apparently the WordPress team has a habit of changing the structure of that XML from time to time; other conversion solutions that I had found a moment before were a few years old and didn\u0026rsquo;t work, so to speak. Maybe WriteFreely? I already have an account on the Devol instance, but the blog limit for each account is 5 and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to potentially waste one. Plume, maybe? This other blogging platform seemed nice, hosted by many and compatible with ActivityPub (not a necessity for me, but still a nice bonus), but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to set custom CSS; serious shortcoming for this use case of mine, since there is no other way to layout everything in the specific way I need to represent a chat without boilerplate for each paragraph of HTML. The choice of Listed My ideas were finished and, since I was in a hurry to put up this site and start uploading the experiences I had with ChatGPT, considering how oh my goodness it was convenient to copy and paste things directly into Standard Notes, this was the good time to try Listed.\nTo be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m a little worried about the prospect that the weekly backup file of notes could become tens of MB large, but the die has now been cast.\nI could create a second account to be used only for ChatGPT notes, exporting them from the primary one and importing them there, and then deleting them from the first account to lighten the collection, but there are problems. Maybe I can transfer the username, but the links to the individual posts will be broken, because they include automatic IDs, and therefore a redirect to the home page for those who follow an old one. Also, old guestbook messages aren\u0026rsquo;t copied over, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think email subscriptions are transferred either.\nThe thought of \u0026ldquo;what a drag\u0026rdquo; All in all though, for this limited purpose I appreciated how efficient it is to have Standard Notes as the final part of** my workflow. It seems to me to greatly reduce the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m annoyed\u0026rdquo; effect.\nTherefore, considering the pleasure of the discovery, I reflected for a moment on how the \u0026ldquo;what a pain\u0026rdquo; factor is one of the things that holds me back from updating the ctt site more frequently.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s leave aside the thematic pages, which are beasts apart; let\u0026rsquo;s leave aside the long posts, which require strong inspiration and enough writing time; but what the hell, at least something for the MicroBlog, which is all the rage, I would like to create it more often! But I just don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it, for some reason, considering all the trouble I have to go through.\nTo tell the truth, I had already immediately got into the habit of starting to write a post in Standard Notes, so as to be able to manage everything more flexibly, perhaps quickly switching from one device to another. However, if I had to start writing something not long and elaborate, to be published as soon as possible, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like taking action.\n\u0026ldquo;But why don\u0026rsquo;t I switch to Listed at least for my microblog?\u0026rdquo;, I therefore think. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why I even got to the point of making my own static site generator: I need it!\u0026hellip; And even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t need it anymore and could therefore stop using it, I honestly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even want to think about doing something about it like that, after all the work! üòñ\nLimitations of Listed However, to put it nicely, Listed is pretty bare: it barely allows you to insert custom CSS, and format posts in Markdown and a limited subset of *HTML *. I propose my analyzes of the latter below:\nAll elements that are inline in nature are automatically placed in a \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; block (for example, you cannot have \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Erre\u0026lt; /span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;, it will always be \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Erre\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;); Any element attribute other than id, class, or style, (and href or src, as well as I believe stuff like title, width, or height, in appropriate cases) is thrown away: so forget, for example, deviating from the default configuration of the platform regarding the behavior of the links (the rel is not touched); Certain elements just don\u0026rsquo;t work: those with non-standard tags (custom in short, like \u0026lt;pincopallino\u0026gt;) are eliminated, as are \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;, and others apparently stuff like \u0026lt;video\u0026gt; too - but \u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;, so to speak, works, and luckily so does my beloved \u0026lt;details\u0026gt;. It is very clear that absolutely it cannot replace 100% any section of the sitectt, not even that of the MicroBlog, and even if it could it would create fragmentation: the main site would no longer contain all the posts in a centralized way , and anyone interested should therefore follow 2 different sites.\nThe blogoctt with Standard Notes I was almost about to give up, but luckily I had a flash of genius: But I can write on Standard Notes, and have the notes that automatically synchronize as files *on the site *? \u0026hellip;No, there\u0026rsquo;s no way. No, wait, who said that? I say there is a way.\nNow, Standard Notes, as I said, uses a client-side data encryption system, so to access the notes from your account a minimum specialized software should be used.\nThere is sn-cli, the official command line client, which could be useful for creating scripts\u0026hellip; but [it seems to have been abandoned](https://github.com/jonhadfield/sn-cli/issues/ 33): nothing to do.\n\u0026ldquo;My way\u0026rdquo; solution So, here too I speak, and I say: Who said that I have to do things properly and use the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; APIs?\nI say that, given that for some reason the HTML of a blog on Listed (specifically, the page /all, the only one that seems to me to really include everything, and not just the last on Listed from Standard Notes and have a program that does the dirty work - but in this case really simple, since it only has to download and parse 1 file - the job of scraping.\nAnd script fu scripto. I leave it here: gitlab.com/octtspacc/sitoctt/Scripts/ListedDownsync.js ; Be careful though, there is nothing nice to read, also because I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet implemented everything that should serve me in the long term, but for those who want to use it it\u0026rsquo;s there.\nIt is technically independent of the ctt site and static, as it saves simple Markdown files on disk (even if the syntax of the metadata lines written in them is mine; so, in case , some text strings in the program should be changed to support the more classic YAML metadata format).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to say that I really thought of everything, but I came close.\nNo, I still can\u0026rsquo;t decide - due to my paturnias - which standard to use to indicate special blocks (of metadata, or of HTML not to be interpreted by Listed\u0026rsquo;s SSG).\nNo, I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet created the script to start as a cronjob on the server, which every now and then should download the data from the Listed blog and update the files in** the Git repository** if there are updates.\nHowever, I thought about the really mandatory things, such as the possibility for the synchronization program not to overwrite a file already in the repo if this specifies the thing in the metadata. Suppose some mess happens, and I have to modify the post data for the ctt site without touching the note data on Standard Notes: by setting this flag, the synchronization script will not replace it the next time it runs.\nConclusions How to conclude, then.\nToday I\u0026rsquo;ve already written too much (it turned out to be a blog article and not a microblog!), and I\u0026rsquo;ll end it here. But I sincerely hope that all this new efficiency and convenience, having additional technology that works for me, and does not force me to work for it (in theory, anyway the problems must come out, otherwise I am not me!), can make me write more and with more pleasure. Whether on the sitoctt, or on the stone slabs.\nAh, yes, this here was the first post on my Listed blog, it\u0026rsquo;s right to point it out for those reading from the site\u0026hellip; but I hope that at least the Listed version of the blog can be indexed well and discovered by more people, while we\u0026rsquo;re at it.\nIt is precisely in the hope of achieving this objective that I am accepting some compromises when I write here, such as doing without macros (which I can use with statiso, while here they would produce broken texts and broken links), to ensure that the articles are actually also available on the Listed pages.\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References Updates to the post: 2022-12-16: I added a cover photo for the article, and clarified the final detail I had forgotten. 2022-12-14: I added some extra formatting, and corrected some expressions.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nAlmost two months ago, the DSpacc came to mind somewhat by chance; first as a concept, talking about it with people online, and then directly as the little object that I proudly own.\nThis thing of mine has seen dust, glory, war, and despair. This is exactly what I should have talked about today, what I did recently to remove some dust and thus bring my device back to glory. As I was writing, however, I realized how the context would have been confused if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t given the right space to the story; but alas, the story itself is long, and worthy of a detailed article, so here we are.\nThe beginnings It all started when, at the age of about 6, I received this Nintendo DS Lite as a gift for my birthday\u0026hellip; no, I\u0026rsquo;m not rambling, I\u0026rsquo;m getting there now. For a good 3 years it was my only gaming console - and, for at least 1-2 of those years, my only gaming device, before I got the Galaxy Player or the scassone tablet. For me it was an absolutely indispensable battle object, necessary always and everywhere like my smartphone today, and perhaps for this reason it had a particularly intense life in its first years. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of games, because I only had 2 GB of memory in the flashcart and no physical games (apart from an obscure one, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy until later), but I had some of the top ones. In short, with Pok√©mon, all the main Mario games, and even stuff like Cooking Mama (which was very popular at the time), the enjoyment was always present.\n[](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nintendo_DS_Lite_ (right_side).jpg) _A DS Lite.. not mine, for obvious reasons soon - Havok at en.wikipedia, CC BY 2.5 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5, via Wikimedia Commons _\nThe day of the smash Despite a couple of flashcart mishaps - the first one mysteriously stopped working one day, the second was starting to show serious signs of failure after about 2 years - the little console fought and kept me entertained. One bad day at the beginning of July however, in the early afternoon, returning from the sea, my desire to play went crack, together with the plastic of the zipper when I opened the shell. Oh yes, exactly this is a \u0026ldquo;DSpacc\u0026rdquo;: a split DS. The name might not mean much, I\u0026rsquo;m aware of that, because not only did I coin it, but also very recently.\nAt the moment it seemed absurd to me that simply by opening the console, it could have broken; and it still seems absurd to me today, even though I have discovered that it is a very widespread problem: just type \u0026ldquo;nintendo ds broken\u0026rdquo; on any image search engine to notice how not only are the images showing the broken hinge the majority, but also how those depicting DS and DS Lite are the majority. It seems that, starting from the DSi, Nintendo has in fact redesigned the clamshell mechanism, which until then had proven unsuitable, and has further perfected it with the 3DS; evidently, the original did cah√†.\nThe consequences of damage Despair was about to set in, even though at the time the console continued to work perfectly, because a piece of the plastic on the right of the hinge had simply broken, which has the sole task of ensuring structural integrity. Despair really started to set in the moment I saw the colors on the screen start to shift as I moved the clamshell: there you have it, the cable of the display started to suffer damage. A little later, I think the same afternoon, I went with my father to a shop on the other side of town, to see how much a repair would cost. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the price now, but I decided that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, and that it would be better to buy a nice 3DS, given the interesting games that had been released or were about to be released for the new family of consoles.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember if I continued to use the DS Lite in the following days, because many of the titles I wanted to play required the upper screen, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t like gaming with diminished colors (today it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother me too much, however). In any case, by the end of that week, after several searches in local shops in search of the cheapest price, I got my o3DS XL.. and that it\u0026rsquo;s a whole different story.\nThe Age of Dust From this moment, of course, the old new DSpacc fell into the background. Maybe I still took it sometimes, at least for games like Animal Crossing that only require the bottom panel, because (according to the Diary app, certainly more precise than my memory) in the first 2 weeks of the 3DS I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to play with other than the system applications . Then, however, on the one hand I was slowly able to populate the new console with software, on the other hand the DS Lite continued to break - sooner rather than later, in fact, the upper display started to stop working completely, showing only a white screen with a black spot (?) - dust started attacking the DSpacc. As if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, the flashcart one day said bye-bye! üôÑ Even after years, despite my new console, every now and then I still had to pick up the old one again\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why, given that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do anything special with it anymore, as I don\u0026rsquo;t have games on a dedicated card. that I could use without the top screen. Even years later, perhaps because over time I started collecting some original DS cartridges and felt like starting them, **sometimes I turned the DS Lite back on for a few minutes.\nEverything was great, until, at a certain point, **I even played the SLOT-1 (the one for the DS cards) on the poor console! I remember that he showed some difficulty reading even original slips, but my other memories on the subject are very cloudy. I remember that when I looked inside the slot I saw some bent pins, and that I tried to insert something to straighten them, but in vain. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that by doing this I damaged others, but already at least 3 years ago (compared to the present) I remember that in the slot some pins were broken, missing\u0026hellip; so, either when I stuck stuff in the port I weakened or even disconnected other pins without realizing it, or it is the occasional putting and removing of cartridges, in the hope that some would be read, which has broken the already weakened contacts (and it would be serious, because it would demonstrate the poor quality of the slot).\nAfter this new unexpected event, I could certainly still, via Download DS, use the console for technically limited, volatile software, without the possibility of saving any configuration (or progress, in games), but let\u0026rsquo;s not beat around the bush: what do you do? useful and continuous like this? Practically nothing, and the console had therefore become a paperweight\u0026hellip; until, some time later, at a fair I accidentally found and bought a Pok√©mon Ruby cartridge. Even though it didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a box, I had to have it: finally I could play something complete on my poor little console!\nEdit arranged However, that broken panel was starting to take its toll, literally. The split hinge unbalanced the weight of the entire device, and the top part of the shell remained hanging only thanks to the assorted cables. I had already discovered the concept of GBA Macro a while ago. For non-experts, it involves giving a second life to a DS that has lost its upper screen, to play titles (emulated, or not like the GBA ones, for which the console offers hardware backward compatibility) from previous consoles that their nature possessed only one screen. Online I was already seeing people creating their own personalized ones with uniquely hand-coloured bodies, or by adding LED tubes that create a neon effect, placed in place of the zipper. All fantastic stuff, but if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the desire (and the way, at least at the time it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be found on Amazon.it) to buy a new display to properly repair the console, could I ever start spending on details which, however beautiful, are objectively superfluous?\nI take a pair of scissors, and cut away the cables so the top half of the case remains attached to the main one. And this is it? Can we play again? Well, not exactly. To be honest, making a good Game Boy Macro requires some hardware work a little more elaborate than violently ripping away the broken screen, and for this reason my story has been a little troubled. First of all, a particular operation is practically mandatory, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose the DS features: open the device and - in addition to properly disconnecting the display, speakers, microphone, and antenna cables, without cutting them - solder a small resistor on 2 testpoints of the motherboard. Normally, the console fails POST and shuts down if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t detect the top screen (namely, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t detect the power draw it would expect from the top screen\u0026rsquo;s backlight); soldering a resistor of a value between about 300 and 1000 Ohm in the right places serves precisely to make the system believe that nothing is out of place.\nHowever, I had done my searches on the Web, thus discovering that the POST is not performed to start a cartridge from the SLOT-2 (the GBA one), if **automatic start is set in the system settings ** of a game card if present. Well before committing my violent act therefore, because afterwards I would no longer be able to access the system menu, I set the automatic startup, and made sure that the bottom screen was selected as the panel used in Game Boy Advance mode. Once the crime is done, I see that the console works exactly the way strangers on the Internet had said: it\u0026rsquo;s practically a GBA, as if it had never been a DS\u0026hellip; except that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have speakers, because I have them cut away. üòÖ\nA new plan A little later, however, I started wanting things like Download DS mode.. or backlight adjustment. I decided to buy a kit of screwdriver bits online, which among many also included the damned bit for tri-wing screws, those screws loved by Nintendo exactly as much as they are hated by us idiots who buy their products. With my new very dangerous weapon (this is not my opinion, but that of those who insist on using shitty screws for the objects they produce) I can finally open my DSpacc, in order to solder the resistor .. resistor which I don\u0026rsquo;t have! But I have a piece of gum. Other kind souls on the Internet, in fact, illustrate how the conductive rubbers used for the buttons of the remote controls (and of the DS itself) often have the right resistance value needed in this case. As luck would have it, an old broken remote control I had on hand had suitable rubber pads: by cutting one, and holding it down with my finger on the infamous test points, the console turned on as before I cut the panel off. Here the hard thing was managing to fix that little thing to the motherboard, so that it made the right pressure, and therefore the right electrical contact, on the points where in theory soldering should be made - for the reason that the very word \u0026ldquo;welding\u0026rdquo; suggests. A few centimeters of electrical tape later, which I had to apply and reapply until I could secure it with the right tension, and it seemed that I was done; but fate decided to mock me.\nYet another trouble Given that the great quality device - but not only it, now also \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026quot;phones for 15 years now - does not turn on without a battery connected (only with the external power cable, so to speak), and that it is only the plastic body that keeps the cell stuck and aligned, now that the console was disassembled I had to hold the battery with my hands close to the spring contacts, in those moments of a few seconds in which I simply wanted to verify that the console worked. Well, due to these maneuvers (and I only understood this later), perhaps due to my mishandling of the battery or who knows what, all of a sudden the DS no longer turned on! The POST didn\u0026rsquo;t fail like before, eh, but it just showed no signs of life. Despair rose quickly, I had no idea what had happened and where to put my hands. It was only thanks to Ashfly, who was helping me in chat with my mess, I came to the conclusion that the fuse dedicated to the battery connection had just blown.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t feel bad about me, but not having the resistor that I knew exactly I needed, could I ever have the fuse that I could never imagine would blow? I therefore had to make a beautiful bridge with tin\u0026hellip; Come on, there\u0026rsquo;s no point making too many fuss about it, it will never happen that I connect by mistake, in the battery compartment, a more powerful energy source than that that the console circuitry can handle; the charging port fuse is separate, so it\u0026rsquo;s out of the question that a faulty power supply could discharge literal lightning into the console\u0026rsquo;s CPU.\nIssue resolved I would have liked to reconnect the speaker (the place is located in the lower part of the console) but, on the one hand, having cut the wire and my absolute incompetence in soldering some time (the photo of the jumper speaks for itself) - even if , to date, I know how to solder at least one wire on a large testpoint - and on the other hand the frenzy of closing everything in fear that my insulating tape disaster could move, I preferred to close everything and pretend nothing happened . At least, I still have the 3.5 jack port to listen to audio in headphones.\nSubsequently (well 13 months later\u0026hellip; I thought all this time that the console was beautiful to look at as it was?!?) I refinished the body** a little, mainly using sandpaper to completely flatten the other protrusion that normally serves the clamshell mechanism, bringing it to the state it still is in.\nThe sequel Playing Pok√©mon Ruby on my new GBA Macro, much more compact and lighter than the DS in original form, took a whole new flavor**. I played for dozens of hours, but every now and then it occurred to me that I wanted to have fun with other things on the elegant console. Totally excluding DS flashcarts, because the slot is, as I said, dead, I looked at GBA ones. On Amazon.it, the only online store where I could and can buy, it seems to me that I found already at the time a scassona for no more than twenty euros, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know why *I just looked * - and I have done this more than once - without ever touching (buying).\nSo another good year has passed, and I\u0026rsquo;m just a few weeks ago. A bit randomly, I remember my DSpacc and, since I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about its being out of use, I try to do some slightly crazy stuff, which I talked about in [this entry from 2022-09-18 of the MicroBlog](./MicroBlog/2022-09-18- Quando-Metto-Mano-Io-Spacc.html). At this point, however, I am now entering the story of the contemporary age of the DSpacc, which has far too many implications to talk about. In the next detailed article on the topic there will be plenty of time to talk about how, finally, I dusted off this valiant gaming device in style, which still remains valid despite the bad luck.\nThanks for reading! If you found the story intriguing, then keep your eyes peeled for the sequel! üòÑ\nPss\u0026hellip; The story regarding the Macro modification itself deserves a small dossier on its own, in my opinion. Thanks to the existence of old written messages I can compose it.. should I?\n","date":"October 31, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-10-31-Ancient-history-of-DSpacc/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nA month ago, in the [post of October 18](./2022-09-18- Quando-Metto-Mano-Io-Spacc.html), I briefly said that it was the DSpacc, and what a new mess I had caused.\nWell, this time I did even worse; to understand the proportions, it is good to brush up on what I had written for a second.\nThe card I mentioned has arrived, the software modification to improve it works, and I\u0026rsquo;m still exploring it all a bit. I will have time to talk about everything in a long article, which I am already writing (but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much longer it will take me).\nWhat is important to talk about now is a problem that arose\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t even know exactly when, but I only noticed it now: the L back button was causing some problems.\nI saw that pressing key combinations to access the flashcart system menus had no effect. Getting suspicious, I decide to download a homebrew to test the keys, Diagnose (which can be found from GameBrew.org [[archived page](https:// web.archive.org/web/20220818023822/https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Diagnose)]), and I actually confirm that the L button does not respond to inputs.\nOn Nlhlehde\u0026rsquo;s chat they advise me to soak the button in alcohol to clean it, and then give it some exercise - or, if I wanted to repair it correctly, unsolder the button and put a new one on.\nAt that moment I get bored of opening the console, but I see that two minutes of exercise magically makes the button work again. The operating state, in reality, lasts just a few minutes, and was questionable at the time: on average, 1 click out of 3 was recorded.\nToday I finally decide to disassemble the DSpacc, to see if I can do the service on the key. To my surprise, I see that this is sort of raised from the side; one of the many GND pins has desoldered, while the only one that closes the other side of the circuit, you can barely notice, has broken.\nNow, it cannot be said whether the problems registering the presses were due to the externally smashed button, or to internal problems that have nothing to do with the initial malfunction of the button (and the final destruction occurred due to my pressing the button a hundred of times a minute to make him exercise).. what is certain is that alcohol is not enough to fix üòÖ.\nInitially, I try to solder just above the broken leg, which in itself should solve the problem; unfortunately, the side of the pins is so short, and the button in such an awkward position (since we are talking about a back button), that the solder on my pin touches a little next to it and shorts the ground. This makes the key always pressed, and therefore it\u0026rsquo;s even worse (my flashcart menu doesn\u0026rsquo;t open if any key is pressed at startup!) than what I had before.\nI try to fix the soldering a bit, but no, I can\u0026rsquo;t improve anything.\nAt this point, I think about desoldering the button, because anyway\u0026hellip; and it works fine, perhaps due to the size of the SMD device, small but not too much: the board has remained clean.\nTime to take a new button from the many I have aside, even if much larger than the dorsal one on the DS, and solder it.\nOh well, enough, I\u0026rsquo;m bored of going around it any more: I try to solder a wire on the main contact, but the solder doesn\u0026rsquo;t stick. The DSpacc PCB is deadly, oh. I try and try again\u0026hellip; and in the end the metal pad to solder on comes away. A classic, dare I say, always ends like this! üòë\nWas it better to have a back button that works with great difficulty, or is it better not to have one at all? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to know. The fact is that now I will have to find solutions to the numerous problems resulting from this bad story,\u0026hellip;,,,..,\nP.S, update 2022-10-20: I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a photo of the broken button disassembled, before throwing it away, why not? The microSD in the corner acts as a scale, to make the dimensions clear.\n","date":"October 16, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-10-16-DSpacc-Updates-Cursed-Key/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

It cannot save data on its own, but you have to download the modified HTML file locally each time, or use synchronization systems (I use Git, supported in-app).\nIf I started using it for the sole limited purpose of school study, but then these days I ended up starting to use it a lot also to create my so-called personal and public knowledge base, on everything I can write to the I fly in a non-linear document format that is very well suited to small, quick interconnected notes\u0026hellip; which means it\u0026rsquo;s really interesting.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a bit sorry to say it, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that part of the time I would normally dedicate to the ctt site will be taken away from it, to be dedicated to the newly created OcttKB - which, in this regard, is here on \u0026lt;https://kb.octt .eu.org\u0026gt;.\nAs much as I like everything I have built in recent months, which in fact will continue to live - both as a place in which to express my design style, and as a place in which to publish elaborate and never fragmented content - I must say that I have found a tool which manages to channel some of my thoughts well, those that the CTTT site cannot manage.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to explain too much about the technical side of the advantages or disadvantages of TiddlyWiki now, because we\u0026rsquo;re talking about software that is easy to start using, and absolutely very complicated to master (it will take me time!).\nWhat I will say is that: with its being oriented towards the arrangement of information in small fundamental elements (the tiddlers), which can then be connected to each other to build elaborate information - both with links and with transclusion (when the content of a element appears completely copied in the middle of another, which is done simply by writing {{Element Name }}) - lends itself really well to well-rounded thinking organization in general.\nAs a bonus, TiddlyWiki can be used as a more traditional static site generator: you can write elements into many files, and use the CLI program to compile everything into the monolithic file described above. The official site of the project uses this technique, but for a personal site it is not necessary and in fact, it cancels out the advantage that TiddlyWiki has, of being able to be used as a modern notes app: open, write, everything is saved in the cloud automatically.\nHowever, the CLI program has a function that I find useful: the ability to generate static versions of the site, which do not require JavaScript for navigation. This is great, and I think anyone with a public TiddlyWiki, if they have the tools, should set up a build system to automatically make static pages available on the server.\n","date":"September 23, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-09-23-New-frontiers/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

It\u0026rsquo;s because\u0026hellip;\nThe console\u0026rsquo;s DS slot is broken I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand how, but slot 1 is broken: some pins are simply bent, but 2 are really missing, and the latter unfortunately are some of the important ones, not duplicates like the ground ones. So, no playing any of my physically owned DS games, nor using a flashcart. Pok√©mon is the only GBA cartridge I own I don\u0026rsquo;t have any other cartridges from the GBA! I only have this Pok√©mon one because I found it at a fair years ago and, not having any GBA cartridge but the DS already broken at the time, I decided to buy it. I\u0026rsquo;ve played it quite a bit, but I want more. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have any other cartridges or even a GBA flashcart. The fact is that, also because I had to take a photo for the WikiSpacc article, I took it out the other day. When I see it I regret not using it, but unfortunately there is little that can be done.\nMy crazy mind, however, today recalled an idea that, if I were capable of doing these things, maybe it would have even been good\u0026hellip; but that\u0026rsquo;s me.\nI thought: what if I soldered a DS flashcart in place of the slot?** I didn\u0026rsquo;t think of this out of nowhere, I saw it some time ago in a modification of the DS made by a person who does these things well . In some videos from a year ago, like this, you can see that this other form of DS has a flashcart soldered onto the motherboard.\nI take the screwdriver and bits, and disassemble the console. All OK, I\u0026rsquo;ve done this at least 4 times counting just the DS Lite.\nBut then, I arm myself with a welder\u0026hellip; honestly they should take away my gun license, considering the damage I do.\nThe first thing I find myself having to do is desolder the slot. Ouch.\nAfter cutting the non-electrical points that held the slot to the motherboard - which looked like solder points, but didn\u0026rsquo;t melt - I first started by trying to heat up all the pins slowly, pulling the slot out slightly. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. So I try to heat every single pin and remove the solder with that strange tool used to suck it up\u0026hellip; but little or nothing comes of it. In the end I go back to the initial method, but done faster and more smoothly.. what a disaster!\n![Photo of the area where the DS slot was.](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Misc/IMG_20220918_170148.avif) ![Macro photo of the area where the DS slot was.](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Misc/IMG_20220918_170157.avif) Almost all the soldering points have come off, and now there is brown. I know the trick of scratching away the green layer of the PCB, to expose clean metal to solder on, but there\u0026rsquo;s just no room here. On this card everything is close together, there is not the slightest room for manoeuvre.\nThere are some very small holes with the conductive diameter around them (just as wide as a single copper wire), testpoint type, which actually appear to be connected to where the solder pads I destroyed were connected. Just to, I try to solder up there, but there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no way to do it. Those are small and there is no good space around them, so the pond doesn\u0026rsquo;t settle.\nI just wasted time, and once again demonstrated to myself that I\u0026rsquo;m just not capable of doing soldering work that goes beyond connecting 2 wires to huge pads (which I do poorly anyway, with dirty work).\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to buy a GBA flashcart now, and use it.. to boot DS software. To my surprise, it\u0026rsquo;s possible, and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it next time.\n","date":"September 18, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-09-18-When-I-get-my-hands-on-I-rock/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Just as the mess when you start again is always the same, with the timetables being messed up and in general still having holidays on your mind.\nDue to these factors, I have a little less time in total to do little things.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s add that, due to a curious need of mine, in the last few days I have had to start programming yet another new tool\u0026hellip; I won\u0026rsquo;t start babbling about the thing itself, because this section is for everything except my development adventures, but the travails can be told: I started developing on Thursday, and I only had a minimal working tool last night.\nAll this, because I wanted to exaggerate with the idea (as usual), and because every afternoon from Thursday to Sunday, until early evening, I was [at the fair](./PicoBlog.html#-2022-09-11 -La-fiera) and, returning home tired, the desire to plan was low.\nTo this mix we add another distraction: after 5 years, a new chapter of the Splatoon saga has been released, and therefore there is little to do, you have to play. However, after a brief analysis, I am trying not to play with it too much, to try to sip it as much as possible so as not to consume it immediately.\nToday I didn\u0026rsquo;t play it at all, for example, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ll end the evening without it; but maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because today I had experiments to do regarding dumping digital school books, to have them without DRM.\nBy the way, when I finish the story and have tried even a minimal amount of multiplayer, I will publish a review of the game, which I\u0026rsquo;m already writing along the way.\nAt the beginning I tried to put the game on a PC emulator, but between glitches (which will soon be resolved), a bit of lag, and the inability to play decently away from the desktop, I had to try on real hardware.\nMy Switch console, however, had been working as a server for 7 months now.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nThis article can probably be considered as the first of a series on the site philosophy, if you want to say so.\nTo start, what is better to talk about, if not everything that led to the birth of the site and began to characterize it?\nWhen, 3 months ago now, I had just started to conceive the ctt site, one of the things I felt was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a place in which to arrange my stuff - the stuff to be preserved and shared publicly, at least - in a way that made it tidy, available, watchable, usable, and loss-proof.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go back to before To get to where everything is now, however, it took time.\nDo we want to go back to the end of May for a moment, to see how things were back then? Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a technical table!\nBefore Now Total weight of site sources 40 KB 548 KB Total weight of the site compiled 24 KB 660 KB Total lines of code in static 261 1314 First of all, the entire site in source form took up just a few dozen KB. Normal, the pages could be counted on the fingers of a severed hand and they weren\u0026rsquo;t who knows how rich.\nNow, however, we are at half a MB excluding all multimedia assets (except the favicon).\nEven static, my static site generator that I started developing at the same time as the CTTT site was nothing special: just 250 lines!\nNot that the current 1300 are many - not at all, and it\u0026rsquo;s better that way - but the growth is visible.\nHowever, if, with an image (ignoring that my font didn\u0026rsquo;t load, even though I had already included it at the time), we see how the site was in practice in its first days\u0026hellip; ahhh, but how rough some of the details were , compared to today?\nMy rambling speech still appeared more or less as it does today on the home page, but the rest is barely recognizable.\nEverything seems emptier\u0026hellip; since all the little icons and buttons that I now have at the edges and in the global menu are missing. Yes, the latter already existed; its usefulness in those days was almost nil, considering that the pages present were number 2, but let\u0026rsquo;s say that it was a good thing to have created it immediately.\nThe placectt The writer in the center of the screen, however, has something wrong with her.\nOh yes, there is a curious little anecdote - perhaps not necessary, but for me it is because I\u0026rsquo;m in charge here - which needs to be told properly.\nThose who followed the creation of the site in its primordial days already know this, but the site lived under the name \u0026ldquo;postoctt\u0026rdquo; for a good 2 weeks.\nIn the initial moment of imagining this thing, in fact, the platform did not exist in an exact and defined way. We thought about the \u0026ldquo;place\u0026rdquo;, but in a vague and still confused way.\nIn the end, predictably, I settled on a website.\nFor some reason though, the name \u0026ldquo;postoctt\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t stink to me soon enough. It took me a long time to realize that that name was reminiscent, at least in part, of something related to the post office\u0026hellip; A situation, I would say, not exactly optimal.\nSo, I thought about changing the name to \u0026ldquo;sitoctt\u0026rdquo;.\nOctt\u0026rsquo;s site The only really important thing, however, has never changed: \u0026ldquo;occt\u0026rdquo;.\nAt the end of the name there is always Octt, that is me. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s a site, a place, a post office, what matters is that it\u0026rsquo;s mine; and speaking precisely of this, of the fact that the site is mine, there is a lot to say.\nThe site is mine because I have complete freedom to make it the way I want.\nIf already in the mid-90s the only real limit for a website was the creativity of the person who built it, today the potential of the Web platform is truly infinite; although, in a certain way, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem that way at all if you only frequent the common Web.\nThe sites of the \u0026ldquo;non-personal\u0026rdquo; Internet all have the same same and banal appearance.\nMany blogs or demo sites use recycled graphic templates. Modern social platforms (Mastodon, Friendica, Pleroma, and so on and so forth) limit customization to a photo, a banner, and a description. Stuff like Misskey already does more, but it absolutely doesn\u0026rsquo;t reach the levels of total customization, with granular precision, that only a site The Web - even if it were a forum like those of the past, and not a private space - allows.\nGreat expressiveness And here\u0026rsquo;s another of my desires that unconsciously condensed itself as the purpose of the site: creating something that I felt was missing not only for what affects me, but the whole of the community of Artisanal web in general.\nThere are several other sites founded on this idea, of using the Web with tools, including manual ones, to express one\u0026rsquo;s personality, creativity and imagination, but: almost none are in Italian (one day I will talk about this too), and in any case I am pleased to contribute to the growth of what can be considered a global collection.\nWith websites you can choose in the smallest details animations, colors, backgrounds, fonts, arrangements, alignments, categorizations, embellishments, interactions, but always remaining in the field of documents.\nReally nice is the fact that with handwritten CSS, even just a few dozen lines, you can already establish a unique graphic identity. Then the real bulk of the code only translates into minor (but still appreciable) details.\nLeaving aside the means: this, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a collateral gallery, was one of my initial goals. In recent months I\u0026rsquo;ve left it aside a bit, in the sense that I\u0026rsquo;ve mainly focused on creating content, thinking that ‚ú® the sparkling details ‚ú® I could put them when it happens.. and I should start doing it, honestly! At the moment only the home page has great particularities, if we exclude the overall style of the site which I have worked on with a minimum of regularity.\nThe importance of content Not that it\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing to put content first, anyway; in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. A site without real content and not regularly updated may perhaps be a piece of art if made to be beautiful or to have intrinsic meaning - but in itself it is not useful.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s something you find, admire, maybe share\u0026hellip; and it all ends there. It is the content that gives real meaning, that guarantees a long life for the site, and keeps the public coming back from time to time.\nThe organization Contents which, for goodness sake, must also be decently ordered.\nI try, it took me a long time to arrive at what I have now, with a global menu that first of all includes fixed pages, such as the home page, because they have no specific category or because they are of particular importance.\nImmediately following this, I have a list of sections, which I wanted to call \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo;. They are links to pages that contain lists of any other page of a given topic. This path is also circular, considering that, from the individual content pages, you can click on the automatically generated entries to visit the pages of the relevant categories.\nFor now, there are perhaps a little few pages in the classic sense. I won\u0026rsquo;t repeat them here one by one because well - but even if I did, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to create a wall of links. Their particular reason for existing is told on them.\nThe real bulk of the site is in the blog articles.\nFor me there is a conceptual division to be respected between the two types of pages. Traditional ones can be something incomplete, always updating, work-in-progress by nature; the article pages should instead be created once, properly, and then ideally never touched again. I can create the normals as a draft, and update them a little whenever I want; the blog ones, however, remain private while I write them, and then, when they are finished, they become public. The latter require me to work more in the moment, and therefore they come out more rarely, but they are more loaded with content.\nDigging up some things New little things, made especially for the site, I have put and will put many, but the idea is to fill the place with even old stuff.\nSome non-exclusive content is still already available in my other places on the Internet - in some cases without a license - like perhaps on my Mastodon profile; others, like very old posts from my Telegram channel, are archived and inaccessible except to me.\nThose not archived are simply messy and poorly preserved, as well as without guarantees for those who want to copy or reuse them; those, however, which for one reason or another are archived, it is as if they did not exist for the world, and it is easy for me to lose them too.\nSome of this data may have value, so this is unfortunate.\nLike a month ago I announced with my decretocto (you didn\u0026rsquo;t understand a thing, right?), this is something that requires tedious work (taking the old one, evaluating its quality, copying the text, paste it into the new text files, layout it well, download photos and videos, optimize them well and upload them\u0026hellip; nothing but the fun of creating, here it\u0026rsquo;s an assembly line!), but it has to be done.\nWith my free time I have already started doing it, and I will continue.\nPosts from my old blog should also be archived here, again for organization and preservation - but those are easier.\nTo conclude: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter which ones, but in any case the contents are the meaning of the site. They are, however, only because they are freely available to anyone.\nWhat does this really mean? Anyone who has read home should perhaps know this. I don\u0026rsquo;t dare add anything else, in any case; you will have to wait for a next article, one in which I will pick up the topic where I leave it now.\nYou too are the meaning of the sitectt.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nStorage memories, whatever their category, degrade with wear.\nNothing can be done to avoid having to change them, sooner or later, after so many years. However, it is possible to keep an eye on their health status, in order to identify any problems.\nWhen it comes to HDD or SSD disks, the [SMART] protocol (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.) comes to the rescue but, if, like me, you use computers in an unconventional way, then checking out classic records isn\u0026rsquo;t enough.\nLinux goes further Something quite secret, which not many people know (so it seemed to me, at least), is that on Linux it is possible to access the statistics of partitions with some filesystems.\nThis, obviously, regardless of whether you are using a pen drive, an SD card, a hard disk, a floppy disk, or even an even less usual memory.\nExt4 provides some curious data - and so should its previous versions, Ext3 and Ext2, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t checked.\nF2FS I also saw, directly from my Android smartphone, exposes some interesting information\u0026hellip; which I won\u0026rsquo;t address in detail, because it\u0026rsquo;s all very obscure and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they mean; and if I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they mean, I\u0026rsquo;m not curious about them. It happens.\nAs for other file systems, I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen them at all. As homework, therefore, I give you to see if stuff like FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, or why not, BTRFS, exposes nice information, on Linux. And how?\nGet the data On Linux, just browse the paths /sys/fs/\u0026lt;filesystem\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;device\u0026gt; to find some interesting files.\nYou can print the contents of each one on the screen, alongside its name, with a simple command (executed in the relevant path): for i in *; do echo \u0026quot;$i: $(cat $i)\u0026quot;; done. Unless you have SELinux active - generally, by default it is only active on Android devices, not on desktop systems - you don\u0026rsquo;t even need root permissions.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve put the most interesting ones in the table below, regarding the microSD of my server (a poor Nintendo Switch that runs Ubuntu non-stop), we\u0026rsquo;ll return to it shortly.\nName Value errors_count 0 first_error_time 0 last_error_time 0 lifetime_write_kbytes 1959125105 session_write_kbytes 1423172308 Speaking specifically about Ext file systems: to even know a few more details, and accompanied by an understandable name, there would also be the command tune2fs -l /dev/\u0026lt;device\u0026gt;. However, this requires root permissions and, while it also reports some of the data that can be obtained by looking at the files from before, such as the number of lifetime_writes, these may be out of date, and relating only to the last mount of the partition. So, better pay attention to these.\nThis time too, I\u0026rsquo;ll bring back the interesting things.\nName Value Filesystem created Mon Jul 26 04:33:17 2021 Last mount time Fri Apr 15 11:55:30 2022 Mount count 16 Things to watch for Let\u0026rsquo;s see, one by one, the usefulness of these values.\nIt must be taken into account, however, in case you have not understood, that the values ‚Äã‚Äãspeak of the state of the partition, not of the storage media. We can read them only because Ext4 saves them and, consequently, if the partition is formatted, then these values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãare also reset. Furthermore, we consider that they could easily be altered by anyone with simple programs like tune2fs, so they are not to be taken as perfectly good if untrusted people have access to the memory.\n‚Ä¢ Filesystem created: The date the partition was created. Simple, but it can be useful for making health estimates, together with the next data. ‚Ä¢ Mount count: The number of times the partition has been mounted. This can be interesting, if we are talking about memory that is not used permanently on a machine that is always on. If SMART did not exist, which gives this and even more data, this value would be very useful on HDDs. ‚Ä¢ Last mount time: The date the partition was last mounted. We can use it in combination with other data, and that\u0026rsquo;s it, I think. ‚Ä¢ session_write_kbytes: The amount, in KB, of data written during the current session, i.e. since the last mount. Together with the value described just above, we can use this to know how much we have written in an active period of time (the current one). ‚Ä¢ lifetime_write_kbytes: The amount, in KB, of data written since the partition was created. This information is particularly useful about microSD, at least if you use it intensively like me. It\u0026rsquo;s also on F2FS. ‚Ä¢ errors_count: The number of errors, I believe both in reading and writing, that occurred over time. Frequent errors can be a symptom of unreliable or simply degraded memory. ‚Ä¢ first_error_time and last_error_time: Dates of the first and last time an error was logged, respectively. It can be useful to understand if any errors occur continuously, and therefore it is necessary to investigate further; or, if a mistake happened once and then never again after a long time, and therefore you are fine like that. When is it necessary to check your health like this? Well, OK, this information is interesting, but: when is it actually needed?\nIf the storage memory in use - which, if we have decided to resort to these measures instead of using SMART, is probably a microSD or a flash drive - starts to show signs of failure, perhaps slowing down over time, or corrupting data\u0026hellip; It would be advisable at least check that everything is OK.\nIf the data isn\u0026rsquo;t scary, but seems in order\u0026hellip; then it\u0026rsquo;s time to first do a complete formatting (including recreating the partition table from scratch), something made simple by programs like [GParted](https:// gparted.org), and then you see how the story continues.\nIn any case, just to be careful, it would be a good idea to always carry out routine checks, so as to be able to predict problems before something serious happens.\nKeep an eye on microSD? Speaking of microSD cards: they are almost disposable, they have an extremely limited life, given that their memory chips are the waste from the manufacturing of other, higher-end memories, such as SSDs.\nWhat is known about their actual durability, at least of those that came out well from the factory and not of sub-brands?\nYou read all sorts of things online: there are those who say that every single memory cell can withstand 10,000 rewrites, and those who say that you can at most write 1,000 times the capacity of the memory before it completely fails (going into read-only mode)\u0026hellip; no conclusion is reached.\nI have had cards like the one examined today, with a capacity of 32 GB, which, apart from the almost 2 TB written since the last formatting, in my opinion has seen at least 3 TB in total in its entire life, and yet it still seems fine; and then, I\u0026rsquo;ve had cards that started giving problems for much less. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I used the latter with crappy file systems, like FAT32 or exFAT, and for this reason they were constantly corrupting.\nIn conclusion: if we abuse betting slips, it is good to be able to control them, to the extent possible, in the way we have learned today.\n","date":"August 9, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/note/2022-08-09-Check-interesting-statistics-and-health-of-partitions-on-Linux/","section":"NotesüìùÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

A console that, 15 years ago, was able to innovate the market with the same spirit with which the Gameboy innovated in its time. A console whose exclusives remain, even today, timeless pearls.\nAs much as I would like to sing endless praises to the DS, however, today I\u0026rsquo;m here to talk to you about something else. Today I\u0026rsquo;m talking to you about emulation, and about a specific area of the NDS emulation scene: the Android one.\nEmulation in general Many consoles, in their years of life and even after, are reversed by passionate and capable people who are interested in understanding how these work, and then perhaps create emulators, i.e. software that replicates the operation of the console on a completely different machine. The Nintendo DS, of course, is no exception.\nTypically, emulator development occurs under one of 2 philosophies:\nCreate something fast, that works, and immediately allows as many people as possible to use the emulator as a practical alternative to the original console; Create something accurate and as technically close as possible to the original console, in order to preserve it in a metaphysical form for the future, putting speed into the background, which can only be achieved by running the emulator on a sufficiently powerful machine, even if also future. \u0026ldquo;Here and now\u0026rdquo; emulation Although the second philosophy is undoubtedly the most noble, that of the \u0026ldquo;here and now\u0026rdquo; is also very important: it allows those who cannot afford the original console or have reduced it to spacc to play .miraheze.org/wiki/Spacc), makes things easy for those who want to develop their games, and improves the lives of players who, with an emulator, can enjoy many conveniences never seen before.\nAt the moment, I am one of the people who play on emulators despite owning the original console. I have a Nintendo 3DS XL, which is backwards compatible with DS games, but badly, to the point that for me it\u0026rsquo;s worse than playing on a phone: the games take a long time to start, they scale poorly on the screen, and it\u0026rsquo;s an additional device (bigger and heavier than my smartphone) to carry around.\nThe state of the NDS emulation DS emulation on mainstream PCs is currently in very good shape. The best emulator there to date is undoubtedly melonDS: free, supports online play, is fast enough, and is accurate. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t run very well on PCs from maybe 10 years ago but, in this situation, if you are content to play offline, you can always count on the excellent DeSmuME (which is apparently back in development for a few months?!).\nThe simple fact that I\u0026rsquo;m writing this article, however, should make you smell trouble; problems that, in fact, exist. While on PC we can say we are fine, on mobile the situation is not rosy at all. In general, on low-end embedded devices (not just smartphones, even single-board computers), the two emulators I just mentioned don\u0026rsquo;t work very well.\nMy mobile experience On my current phone, with Android 10 operating system (stock variant from the manufacturer Xiaomi, MIUI 12) and SoC Snapdragon 662, neither melonDS nor DeSmuME they make the games run satisfactorily. Of both emulators I tried both the respective unofficial native Android ports, and the available Libretro cores (already present or downloadable in the latest version of the respective applications below) for the RetroArch and Lemuroid frontends.\nSo, before continuing I should perhaps make a clarification. The tests I\u0026rsquo;ve done in recent days were done with just one game, namely Animal Crossing Wild World, for a very simple reason: at the moment I\u0026rsquo;m interested in playing this one on my smartphone, and that\u0026rsquo;s it. So, the only thing I care about is that this game runs perfectly. Already with this, I hear people screaming at the lack of scientific nature of my tests, which are actually limited in scope; let them be satisfied, I say, this is a personal blog, not a research laboratory ü•±Ô∏è. In any case, I have tried all these emulators several times in the past with other games too, and my opinions today are more or less in line with my past ones - but now I\u0026rsquo;ll go into detail.\nVaried tests Keeping in mind that these tests were done simply by looking at the performance of the Animal Crossing Wild World title screen (which requires approximately the same performance as the game running in the overworld requires):\n‚Ä¢ APK compiled on November 13, 2021 of the unofficial port of melonDS for Android: It runs practically as the previous version did about a year ago, July 2021, the period in which I got the new phone; ‚Ä¢ Core Libretro by melonDS, a little more updated: Runs slightly better than the native port, but not quite perfect; ‚Ä¢ APK compiled on August 27, 2017 of the dead fork of nds4droid by tangalbert919, whose (equally dead) upstream project is an unofficial Android port of DeSmuME: Perhaps with frameskip at 3 it runs a little better than the APK, but a little worse than the Libretro core, by melonDS; ‚Ä¢ Core Libretro by DeSmuME: It basically runs like the latest version of the original nds4droid branch (2016) (yes, I also tested that APK just for, but I won\u0026rsquo;t say it other than because it\u0026rsquo;s not relevant); Worse than anything seen above. As a bonus, I also mention this other emulator that I discovered by chance while looking for stuff: NooDS. The goal is to be a fast emulator, but at the moment, from what I have seen and from what the README says, we are not there yet. It works more or less like the melonDS APK I mentioned so far. I hope that development continues and is successful, however, the project promises.\nSo, is this the end of the story? Should I be satisfied with emulating the game slowed down by at least a good 7-10% on melonDS? Well, actually, no.. maybe.\nOnly one solution In the Android NDS emulation scene, all the emulators I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about so far are actually the least famous (although melonDS has been gaining traction lately). There is a much better known one, which anyone who has tried to emulate the DS on Android at least once will know at least by name. So, let\u0026rsquo;s talk a little about Drastic.\nDrastic is the fastest Nintendo DS emulator for Android. It\u0026rsquo;s not accurate at all, but it runs all games without major glitches, and already on low-end smartphones from 5 years ago it can run practically any 2D and 3D game at full speed; On even older devices it may be a little iffy, but it remains a true miracle. For example, look at the videos under \u0026ldquo;[2019-09-17 15:16] Various tests with the Galaxy Player\u0026rdquo; on my page [MicroBlog Archives of September 2019](./MicroBlog-Archive/2019/09/index .html). It is absolutely absurd that that device, which I bought for just 90 euros 9 years ago, is already able to emulate the DS in the first place; let alone making a game like Super Mario 64 DS run excellently.\nWhere\u0026rsquo;s the catch? Eh eh, where do we start?\nTrouble ahead First of all, Drastic is proprietary software; This alone, for me, is bad. Even if, unfortunately, I can\u0026rsquo;t do it 100%, I would like to use as much free software as possible. Since this emulator is the only one that is a sliver, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a real alternative. I\u0026rsquo;m keeping the proprietary emulator and never mind, it\u0026rsquo;s not the end of the world, also considering that the games I want to emulate are themselves proprietary, and that even the original console (in my case, with the 3DS, even worse, because it has a entire OS rather than just a BIOS) is proprietary.\nThe real serious obstacle here lies in the fact that Drastic integrates a DRM, i.e. a Digital Restrictions Management system. In theory, this would mean: if you pay for the program, you can\u0026rsquo;t use it unless you find or create a crack. At least, this is the theoretical idea of DRM in general. In practice however, and the Defective by Design FAQ (an anti-DRM campaign) certainly explains it better than me, DRM does more** harm** to consumers than it does good to producers.\nIn this specific case, what is Drastic\u0026rsquo;s DRM problematic, besides the fact that by design it denies access to a useful program to those who cannot spend ‚Ç¨4.49? It\u0026rsquo;s problematic because it relies on purchasing from Google Play; this means that those who do not have Google Play Services and Google Play Store on their device - like me who, for privacy and performance reasons, have always removed them from mine for years - even if they perhaps make the purchase from the Google Play site and install the application by logging in with the Google account on Aurora Store, will not be able to use the purchased app, because it will not have the possibility to verify the purchase on the device.\nThe appikapposa tradition In short, in any case, the only possible solution to actually use the little program is to have a patch. In the past, both when I couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford Drastic, and when I can but no longer have Google Play, searching for the patched APK on the Web - done every time I updated Android or changed devices - was in itself the boring game that it preceded the prettier game (the one emulated in the working app). Often it was necessary to look for a new APK, both because Drastic\u0026rsquo;s DRM has always been stupid and the cracks often stopped working, and because the interactive part of the application was and is written with feet: it uses system APIs in strange ways, which With each new version of Android Google breaks, and therefore breaks the app.\nA version of Drastic that I used on my old phone with Android 7, in fact, doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on my current one: the file selector simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t see files and folders in the storage memory. Even an old trick, using an external file manager to open a ROM in the emulation app, no longer works on Android 10: the app crashes. So, I find myself having to look for the most updated cracked version. I looked it up the other day and apparently downloaded something that worked. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that - and this is the shitty DRM I was talking about, also according to what people report who, on the official Drastic forum, ask for support despite having pirated the program (it takes courage oh, a medal for these fearless heroes) - after you start a game just once or twice, every subsequent time the app closes in your face (that\u0026rsquo;s right, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t crash, it closes, because the Android error message doesn\u0026rsquo;t come out).\nAt this point, the situation looks really bad. What to do?\nWhat is Google Play hiding? I remember that on the Play Store itself - and I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to the implications of this at the end - you can find a free application, [Free DS Emulator - For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details ?id=com.cpu.free.dsemulatorv6). I had tried it in the past and, surprisingly, it ran games like Drastic. How is this possible? So is there another fast emulator for Android? Absolutely not, because this app is Drastic. Of course, it is Drastic that has undergone some substantial changes, including, in addition to the removal of DRM: a total rebranding, the restructuring of the menus, the addition of invasive advertising, the rewriting of the file selector (which now at least works, but it is very rough), and, for some absurd reason, the removal of some emulation settings; but it remains technically Drastic. We are therefore talking about a real unauthorized copy of the famous emulator, created with the sole purpose of profiting from the work of others thanks to the advertisements (which, let\u0026rsquo;s give credit where credit is due, in the app Drastic\u0026rsquo;s original at least there aren\u0026rsquo;t any) - advertisements that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see anyway, because I have Adaway installed and always block Internet access to proprietary applications. The only thing I\u0026rsquo;m surprised about, and quite a bit, is that I found this illegal app on the Google store.\nHowever, the creators of the app have put in a lot of effort in removing any reference to Drastic. They almost succeeded. The infamous name never appears in the program, but a decompilation of the APK file via apktool, and then searches in all the extracted files (with grep -iR Drastic * ) of the string \u0026ldquo;Drastic\u0026rdquo;, shows that the name of the app from which the suspicious one stole the code is present 2 times in total, in 2 different files. Just so, here\u0026rsquo;s the confirmation, in case there were any doubts about the nature of this application.\nNew research What can I say? This app works, and is still a great solution, despite being slightly worse than the original Drastic. Except that, at a certain point, I think: is it possible that this is the only illegitimate fork of Drastic found on the Play Store? Consequently, I open Aurora Store and start looking, hoping to find better. Apart from the various rebrands of nds4droid - these too exist only to allow those who put them online to profit from advertising, given that the official app is already on the Play Store, free and without crap - some other elements on the list attract my attention Attention.\nI download 2 apps in particular, very similar but with different names and colors. The screenshots on the application pages smell like scams from a mile away, they look like those apps you find on Aptoide or other alternative stores when looking for cracked programs. Those apps that: if all goes well, do nothing other than show dozens of advertisements when opened; if it goes bad, they\u0026rsquo;re malware, bluntly.\nBoth, when I open them, present me with a \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo; button which, when pressed, starts the installation of an APK (I think patched) of Drastic (!!!). You understood correctly: this app, coming from the Play Store, contains in its package an APK file (don\u0026rsquo;t even download it from the Internet!), cracked , from another app. One of the two, among other things, also integrates the pirated ROM of a DS game that I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of before: Zoo Quest Puzzle Fun. How kind, what a nice gift, not only the free emulator but also the free game. It seems like we\u0026rsquo;re on strange app stores, but instead we\u0026rsquo;re on Google Play.\n![Screenshot of the Google Play pages of the 2 apps, side by side, and screenshot of the list of copyright infringing files in one of the two APKs.](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Emulation-NDS-Android/Adware-Emulator -Installers.avif)\nFor the skeptics, I not only refer you to this video that I recorded a few days ago , but I invite you to download the applications in question (and, perhaps, block network access or deactivate the Internet connection before starting them) and see everything first-hand: [Green Emu NDS](https://play.google .com/store/apps/details?id=com.nud.ndsemu), The FrieNDS Emu. However, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a helpful discovery: the goodies given by these apps have the same problems as the Drastic APKs found on the web.\nFinally.. In my visit to the store, finally, I see yet another app that smells like a rebranded Drastic, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, perhaps due to the layout of the buttons in the screenshots: [vDS](https://play.google.com/store/ apps/details?id=com.icorewwwi.vDS). It costs a good ‚Ç¨1.29 but, luckily, after less than 10 seconds of searching I already found the APK reuploaded by other people on the Web, and I installed it. Upon opening it, I confirm my suspicions: the main menu is identical to Drastic\u0026rsquo;s, except for the changed colors. All other menus are also identical, and the emulation engine too. As if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, the folder where it saves the data is exactly the same as Drastic (/sdcard/Drastic!). They didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to hide the theft, these guys!\nAnyway, yes, the emulator works, it opens files and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do the trolling of closing in your face. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it for 3 days now, and I have no complaints.\nSo the story, at least for me, ended well.. but I could add something.\nGoogle, damn. The Google Play Developer Policy categorically prohibits applications that, like the ones I mentioned, violate copyright. Yet, these 4 who are literally stealing all the code of another app, proprietary and sold for a fee, are all still there. Some for months, others for years, but they are there. Technically, even applications that directly and immediately integrate installable apps into them for the sole purpose of being to all intents and purposes \u0026ldquo;packaged installers\u0026rdquo;, like those 2 specific ones, would be against Google Play rules, because they would count as a alternative app store~~ would violate specific rules regarding the use of the Android package installer by apps.1\nIn all of this, however, What does Google do? What does Google do when those that violate the rules are not very famous applications that at the same time bring Google itself some money? He really doesn\u0026rsquo;t give a damn. I thought that no one had tried to report these applications to Google for removal, but actually someone did\u0026hellip; and got nothing. I tried too but, after 3 days, everything is still on the store and I haven\u0026rsquo;t even received a response via email from Google.\nAnd it is precisely in this way that, with this story, today we reconfirm two important facts.\nWhat did we learn? DRM proves, once again, not only as useless (avoidable, given that I would now be playing with a modified version of Drastic with the DRM removed), but above all as harmful (given that, even if I bought Drastic according to the rules, I still couldn\u0026rsquo;t use it on my devices); In general, programs that use DRM, i.e. proprietary software that does not even guarantee \u0026ldquo;freedom 0\u0026rdquo; (being able to run the software as you wish), they prove to be unreliable. It is better to always prefer software without DRM and, when possible, completely free and community-based.\nGoogle, like too many other multinationals, does not deserve a shred of trust. He has rubbish on his store and he deliberately doesn\u0026rsquo;t care, even though in theory he has automatic systems to control marsitis which, among other things, [often cause innocent victims](https://www.ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic .php?t=76643). Before the fanboys arrive: no, okay that the Apple App Store is a little better off than the Google Play Store - also because the fee to publish something there is a huge sum of $99 per year, instead of the [one-off $25](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=it# zippy=%2Cstep-pay-registration-fee%2Cstep-pay-the-registration-fee) from Google - but even there they occasionally throw out questionable apps, often predatory for users. At least, though, Google sees allowing the installation of applications from unofficial sources as a standard part of its operating system, while Apple actively puts a spanner in the works on sideloading because \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s for user safety\u0026rdquo;; In general, you should be wary of the master fathers, and prefer the web pages of the developers themselves to download the apps, or stores like F-Droid.\nI have a little present..! And, finally, I can say I\u0026rsquo;m done. I leave you with a little gift: archive.org/details/Emulation-Archive\u0026lt; /a\u0026gt;. On this Archive.org page I created I put a few things. First of all, the vDS APK, which however only works from Android 4.1 and up; For this reason I also put 2 patched APKs of Drastic vero, one from perhaps 3 years ago and one even older, which instead work from Android 2.3 up (\u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; meaning: until the file selector problem broken does not appear, which I believe is up to Android 5, including it, on many devices). Everyone should be able to play! In the archive there are also other scattered emulators, even free ones, of which I have however archived the right code to preserve it.\nThanks for reading. I invite you to follow the blog, even if not in all future articles there will be free binary files üòÅ! P.S.: How cute are all my androids running ACWW together? I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you the photo, just for.\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References Update 2022-07-29: I corrected this part because I remembered that apps like this violated the rules because they \u0026ldquo;would count as alternative app stores\u0026rdquo;, but in reality I can\u0026rsquo;t verify the What.

His old and new names will literally be replaced by \u0026ldquo;Deadname\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Censored\u0026rdquo; respectively.\nEverything, however, will become clear as you read.\nA special memory So, this story actually began at least 8 or 9 years ago.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly when, but let\u0026rsquo;s say that around that time I discovered Deadname. He created content on the Web and, other than the fact that I really liked it, there\u0026rsquo;s not much more to say.\nSome time later, much to my chagrin, he announced that he would stop making new stuff. From one day to the next he said that the social spaces that were his current domain at the time no longer represented him as a person, or something similar.\nFurthermore, a little later he also made his old content disappear from the internet.\nAt the time I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the slightest idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat he could mean by such a speech but, looking back with my current knowledge, both about my person and what I discovered to be his, I understood perfectly what that sentence meant.\nMeanwhile, even though Deadname had become just a past memory, the years continue to pass and the Earth continues to turn.\nOn some occasions, her character comes to mind, not only to me alone, but also to other people who remember what she was.\nFor example, sometimes a friend of mine and I, speaking in private, since we were first and foremost in this personal situation, joked by saying things like \u0026ldquo;Deadname deleted everything because she had to settle\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd so, every time, she laughed. If something like this, thought and said at random based on nothing, had ever proven to be true, then we would have officially become Official Universal Based Distributors of redpills.\nA (seemingly) new personality Anyway, back to the present day; a few weeks ago, precisely.\nAs practically always, I was at the PC, doing things and seeing them on the Web. At a certain point, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember exactly how, I came across a profile of Censored, which I found to have some interesting things.\nI decide to watch a video of him and, immediately, as soon as I open it, there is some detail that takes me by surprise. The voice, in particular, strikes me as inaccurately modulated. It\u0026rsquo;s a concept I can\u0026rsquo;t exactly explain. In short, we are talking about that kind of modulation which in many people does not raise doubts apart from \u0026ldquo;this voice seems strange to me\u0026rdquo;, but which in me, having a similar personal experience (but I would say more unsuccessful), makes one think \u0026ldquo;but this person is transgender?\u0026rdquo;\nEvidently, however, at that moment I had more important questions in my hands, because, among all his public profiles, I decided to just quickly look at the biographies, some original textual posts, some reshared ones, some photos including some selfies, and just a few second of other videos.\nI found no indication, even veiled, that he might be transgender. I get annoyed immediately, close everything, and go back to mine.\nJust a few days later, I come across Censurato\u0026rsquo;s profile again. A different video catches my attention, so I start watching it.\nThe more I listen to the voice, however, the more familiar everything becomes. In just a minute I understand that, the voice itself, the way of intoning it, and even a little bit of how the video was made\u0026hellip; everything, everything had an aftertaste of Deadname, despite the two characters being of practically opposite genders.\nThe investigations begin I decide to let her friend know this immediately before she, curiously, says she thought the same thing.\nThe stakes this time are really too high to pretend nothing is happening, so we start via chat to collect elements, of any kind, that may coincide between Censored and Deadname, cross-referencing everything we can obtain about the person, and the little that we have more left.\nWe start with interests, which all seem to match, even the strangest ones. Even the taste in niche memes seems the same.\nEven some personal and social details - such as about his family, his cultural status, or the area in which he lives - are consistent with Deadname\u0026rsquo;s past (even if only my investigation partner remembered these details, I didn\u0026rsquo;t).\nSome content still available online, because it was created in collaboration with other creators, was useful in refreshing the memory of further small details, about her childhood for example.\nBig shot! All these discoveries, however curious, could very well have been a series of coincidences.\nHowever, we did the really big coup, which removed all doubts, because:\nSome particular physical signs, compared between photos of Censured and a few deleted videos (but which we have kept for years!) of Deadname, match perfectly;\nOne of the online services used by Deadname at the time keeps a publicly accessible history of all username changes made; the account that was created with the name Deadname has changed its name over time, to Censored.\nCase solved And it is exactly like this, with both small and large details that fit together perfectly, that the puzzle is officially complete: the two characters investigated are the same individual.\nThe redpill said without knowing, therefore, turned out to be such.\nI, however, have no idea why Censured necessarily had to embark on this undertaking to cover his old tracks. I understand, now, why he wanted to delete his old contents: because the character that appeared in them no longer corresponds to who he is today on a gender level - but I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why pretend that the past never existed .\nI would say that I am quite happy to have found again, after so many years, even if as a slightly different character, the same person who managed to entertain me in the past, and I am happy that he still has the passion to do what he did well.\nThe social digital footprint This story - which I would say has a happy ending, because I have revealed an important mystery for me - has a clearly visible dark side: it can be said that it proves the existence of a social digital footprint, as I like to call it, which every person has.\nWith this term I mean a truly unique identifier, which allows anyone who wants, if the basic conditions are met, to identify a specific person always and in any case, despite any partial changes in identity.\nI see this imprint as composed of everything that is objectively true about a given individual: the things he likes, the things that have shaped his personality, his social connections, his bodily characteristics, and the things he does or has never done, as well as who knows what other elements that I now forget.\nWe are not even talking about something strictly linked to the online world, clearly, even if in some cases, as we have seen now, some things about us that touch the Internet form strong elements of the imprint.\nHow to protect yourself As long as you are not doing it to escape, so to speak, the consequences of complete immorality, wanting to reset your social footprint, to live in the world as a totally new person, is legitimate; that\u0026rsquo;s why I protected the identity of the person in the story.\nBut then, how do you do it?\nProtecting yourself from tracking is possible, but it is not at all simple. Just as to protect your computers from web tracking you need to use browsers like Tor Browser which - when communicating with other computers - omit some data and mask others, to protect your personal identity from social tracking you need to avoid sharing too much of yourself with the world, even going so far as to lie if necessary.\nUndoubtedly it is impossible to hide what some of the things we are passionate about are, if we have the desire to share them with the world, and perhaps discover like-minded people.\nOther things, though - for example, what relatives you have, the name of your first pet, what places you frequent, or how your passion for something began - if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to erase your past and carry yourself as a totally new person, it\u0026rsquo;s better not to tell them out loud.\n","date":"July 17, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-07-17-%EF%B8%8F-How-our-social-digital-footprint-screws-us/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nFor almost 7 years I have had an Acer laptop, Aspire V3-572G, undoubtedly now a bit old, without praise and with some infamy.\nWhen it was purchased, it was essentially a mid-range notebook like any other, without any notable features. I mean, I used it quite a bit and it more or less always did what it was supposed to, until about 2 years ago I started demanding to use heavy games and development tools, at which point the new (desktop) PC was great. obligation.\nThe current state All in all, with GNU+Linux as the operating system, the Intel mitigations not installed (yes, I actually deleted the microcode, rather than blocking its loading), and a SSD installed in place of the HDD years before, the machine is still more than good for many activities that today I carry out primarily with the desktop PC.\nThe Intel [i5-5200U](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/85212/intel-core-i55200u-processor-3m-cache-up-to-2 -70-ghz/specifications.html) itself still grinds well, and the 4GB of RAM isn\u0026rsquo;t a huge issue if you have a light system stack and aren\u0026rsquo;t keeping 50 programs open at once.\nA little problem Where are the infamies, I hear you thinking?\nFor at least a year now, my use of the laptop has dropped significantly, because an initially small problem has, all of a sudden, become enormous.\nThe smasher Going in order, - I don\u0026rsquo;t remember precisely, but we\u0026rsquo;re talking about at least 3 or 4 years ago, when this was my only personal PC - the problems started when the W key stopped working, over the course of a few days. Az.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true that I\u0026rsquo;m a Linux user, and that at the time I was also excessively gamer, but I never hammered that or any other button, contrary to what the stereotypes about my categories may tell you.\nThe lesson to be learned here is: if you are at home, and therefore have the opportunity to use an external keyboard, it is better to use that one to play, otherwise over the course of a few years you will completely burn out the key you use (in many 3D video games). to move forward.\nThe funny thing is, like I said, the button broke within a few days, not right away. Initially it only became hard to register the pressures, which inevitably led me to press harder and harder, until I evidently broke through it.\nAcer shit? I\u0026rsquo;d say, Acer shit.\nBut, it seems, all laptop manufacturers, even the big and famous ones, often mistakenly associated with quality only because of their fame, too often churn out products with terrible design or construction errors. The laptop that unfortunately happened to me, as we understood, was no different.\nThe consequences At this point, the PC had become only slightly inconvenient to use in some situations.\nThere were no big problems on my desk, I connected a USB keyboard and that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the story.\nIn other situations, typing the W (you don\u0026rsquo;t need a sledgehammer to write in Italian, but you do for many other things) began to require the use of the on-screen virtual keyboard, with the mouse to press the W, which would then start to go around CTRL+C and CTRL+V whenever I needed.\nIn any case, from that moment, the use of the notebook keyboard reduced, both because I used an external keyboard when possible, and because a little later I assembled the new PC and started using the laptop less in general (difficult do otherwise, when there is comfortable space on the desk for only one external keyboard, which for obvious reasons must be connected to the fixed PC).\nWhat is very strange is that, since about 1 year ago, despite little use, many other keys quickly started to fail, out of nowhere. I can\u0026rsquo;t say if any other keys then completely died, but certainly at least 60% of the keyboard started to want beats to register the pressures.\nThis is where my laptop use plummeted.\nI realized Just a few days ago, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, perhaps because with the desktop PC I don\u0026rsquo;t even have the convenience of moving to another room to use the computer - something I would like to do to escape the terrible heat that develops in my room in the summer - it occurs to me that I would like to use the laptop.\nI spend like 30 seconds thinking about why the idea unconsciously has a bad aftertaste for me, and then it occurs to me\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll report verbatim what I wrote on my Telegram channel (which I use as a microblog) at that moment.\nHm, I just consciously thought: \u0026ldquo;but why do I practically never use my laptop even at home where it\u0026rsquo;s convenient for moving from one room to another?\u0026rdquo;\nThen I remembered that like half the keyboard doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\nAcer Shit Incredible how, due to the broken keyboard, I unconsciously began to develop a sort of passive repulsion for my (only) laptop, slowly stopping using it If only it were easy to buy a replacement keyboard\u0026hellip;\nRightly, in the comments, a person points out to me that I should have easily found the replacement keyboard I need on Amazon.it and\u0026hellip; he wasn\u0026rsquo;t wrong.\nI honestly should have bought it right away when the W broke, but, trivially, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I didn\u0026rsquo;t. My memory tells me that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it on Amazon at the time, but honestly I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much to trust. And in all this other time I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it.\nThe replacement keyboard arrives Without wasting too much further time, I made sure to order it (3 days later, but it could have been much worse), and after 2 days it was already at home (earlier than the reported delivery period). 20+7‚Ç¨.. well spent? It\u0026rsquo;s a must see.\nI think the price of the keyboard is right, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the shipping price \u0026gt;:(.\nThe keyboard was only available in black, and everything else on my PC, including the factory keyboard, is white instead.\nThe chances of something horribly bad coming out are high, but I\u0026rsquo;m a Linux user: I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to fix my broken laptop for a long time instead of telling people it\u0026rsquo;s the best computer you can use; Imagine if I care whether it\u0026rsquo;s bad or not, if it works it\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nThe replacement I don\u0026rsquo;t lose heart, and I begin to unscrew the countless screws that hold the laptop body together, and I separate the plastic sections. Then I disconnect the 3 flex cables for the power button, keyboard, and touchpad, and lift the upper part of the body. Nothing new, however, I already had to do this procedure when I installed the SSD.\nAfter this, however, other screws. Damn! All these screws, and it becomes a mess to put everything back in place. No more screws.\nBut we must continue. Once the screws (damn!!) that hold the keyboard together have been removed, between the external plastic support and the internal metal one, you can remove the old keyboard and put the new one on, and then do everything else in reverse.\nOr almost.\n![The plastic (external) and metal (internal) frames, which serve to hold the keyboard together, are separated](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Repair-Aspire-V3-572G/Keyboard-Frames-Disassembled. avif)\nChores \u0026ldquo;while I\u0026rsquo;m at it\u0026rdquo; Since I was there, I also wanted to take the opportunity to clean the fan and its filter a little, which over the years have accumulated dust, allowing less air to pass and thus allowing the CPU to reach a good ~50¬∞C in idle .\nI thought more powder, honestly, oh well.\nI also checked the thermal paste on the fly (perhaps too quickly).\nTo do this, I had to turn the motherboard upside down, after removing even more screws. You could see some of the paste outside the CPU perimeter, and what little I saw didn\u0026rsquo;t seem particularly dry. I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know how often the thermal paste should really be changed unless it\u0026rsquo;s very dry, so I left it alone.\nShould I actually have unscrewed (what a pain!!!) the heatsink from the processor and seen what the paste was like there? I don\u0026rsquo;t care, no more screws.\nThere would be another problem, which I wanted to take advantage of to fix, but about which there was no way to do anything.\nAlso many years ago, the tip of a faulty audio cable broke, getting stuck in the 3.5mm jack port of the laptop (damn!!!!!), and all my poor attempts in the past to remove it from the outside have always failed .\nUnfortunately, even internally, the door is an almost completely closed piece of plastic, so my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinserting something into the internal perforated part also failed, because simply there is no hole. Maybe nothing will happen if I create the hole with the right tool, manage to push out the stuck piece and the door works as it should again\u0026hellip; but, for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it alone.\nYou can see that I will continue to use the USB sound card (‚Ç¨6 on Amazon) to use earphones, as I have done for years now.\nWork finished! With a bit of difficulty, I put everything back together, and admire the new state of the PC - which among other things, in idle after startup, now that I\u0026rsquo;ve cleaned the fan, reaches ~40¬∞C, I would say definitely better than before !\n![The laptop reassembled and turned on, with both the new keyboard and the old one (placed on top) visible, as well as my desktop](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Repair-Aspire-V3-572G/Laptop- Reassembled-Acceso.avif)\nWhat can I say, you can see that I use GNU+Linux.\nNot only does the laptop now have an ugly aesthetic contrast (but at least it works!), but in the photo you can see what the old white keyboard looked like: filthy and yellowed. Oh, at least it matched the theme of my terminal emulator, light solarized - it did and doesn\u0026rsquo;t anymore, unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit sorry.\nRegarding the old keyboard, I must make it clear that I lost the plastic of the W key after the key itself had already broken, so don\u0026rsquo;t go saying that my keys break because I start detaching them: the truth lies in the exact opposite.\nThis is also why I won\u0026rsquo;t try to remove the black markers from the new keyboard to put the old white ones in their place\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the risk of breaking a few keys.\nSmall bonus: a photo of the bottom of the old keyboard.. the W key is actually broken.\nThe right choice To conclude: the keyboard, from the little I have tried it, works well, except for a few keys (like SPACE), which seem a little hard and not very elastic (but which can still be pressed).\nI only regret not buying it sooner.\nA curious detail, but which absolutely doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me think I\u0026rsquo;ve made a wrong choice, is the fact that an area of ‚Äã‚Äãkeys on the left is not exactly level with all the others. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a problem in practice but, aesthetically, well, it makes me laugh.\n![The leftmost keys (W to F) of the new keyboard, appearing just slightly sunken inward at one corner](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Repair-Aspire-V3-572G/Keys -Sunken.avif)\nDon\u0026rsquo;t throw away your laptops if they have some small problem that can be solved easily and cheaply.\nIf you break the keyboard, you change that; if Windows becomes unbearably slow, install a Linux distribution (GNU is recommended, but not mandatory!) that meets your needs.\nBy doing so, you not only save a lot of money; electronic waste, the so-called e-waste, is reduced and therefore a minimum amount of good is done for the environment.\nNote: Some of the photos in this article are available in JPEG, less compressed, on my Pixelfed profile: pixelfed.uno/p/octo/451398427740616761\n","date":"July 9, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-07-09-How-I-fixed-my-laptop-with-25/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nMaybe a year ago, partly out of curiosity and partly because I already imagined that it might have been something convenient, I developed a marginal interest in smartphones equipped with complete physical keyboards.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t mean the damn numeric keypads, which you still see on non-smart phones today, I mean keyboards with dozens of individual keys dedicated for letters and symbols.\nThis type of keyboard was already rare to see on phones prior to the smartphone era: it first appeared not on ultra-cheap models, but in any case it might not always be very comfortable due to its small size.\nThe more smartphones began to spread, the more physical keyboards began to disappear, even if they rarely existed on some modern phones, even of generous dimensions.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember if this time last year was just before or shortly after I bought a new smartphone, my current one; the fact is that I had to choose it based on precise and restrictive criteria, first and foremost the cost and, unfortunately, there was no low range with a physical keyboard.\nA new idea As time passed I forgot about the issue a bit, until, a few weeks ago, I came across a video on Invidious (YouTube/JXdLzinnqms) which shows a homemade modification to a smartphone.\nThe video shows, and the linked discussion on cover is thought out.\nI immediately had the desire to create something like this but, as I searched, I started to think that this type of cover is no longer produced by anyone\u0026hellip; it was absolutely impossible to find one, not only at a good price, but at all. Neither online nor in physical stores.\nSince there was no hope, I tried to change my strategy slightly and look for a very small Bluetooth keyboard, but without any strange supports such as covers included: just the rough keyboard, I would have made my own arrangements to attach it to the phone.\nThe search on Amazon was absolutely fruitless, meh. On AliExpress, for around ‚Ç¨13 there was the keyboard I was looking for, but for me buying there is a hassle to say the least. Luckily, however, one of the many all-purpose housewares (those that sell billions of films) in my area had the product I needed, for just ‚Ç¨2 more than I would have paid for it at Ali.\nA bargain, so I bought it.\nAfter purchase At home I took it to charge for a while and tried it on the fly. What can I say, it worked and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find the feeling when typing bad, even though we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a membrane keyboard.\nSo everything is fine.\nOr so it seemed.\nThe next morning, I try to turn on the beautiful little object again, to do some more tests. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t turn on. That? As? I put the keyboard back on the charger, and it actually works after two minutes.\nHow strange, yet I kept it charging for hours the day before. Maybe it didn\u0026rsquo;t charge well from my PC port, so this day too the keyboard remains charging, this time from the block I use for my cell phone and other devices.\nInvestigating oddities The next morning, same issue. Whatever the case, it\u0026rsquo;s evident that the battery is taking a heavy drain, out of nowhere, for some reason. For the record, the keyboard has a physical switch, which I never forgot to turn off after putting the keyboard away\u0026hellip; all very strange.\nI decide to let it charge a little, then disassemble it, and measure the voltage of the lithium battery soldered to the board with a multimeter, which I notice drops by 0.01V approximately every 10 seconds. Oh.\nAssuming the board is properly designed, so that the physical ON/OFF switch cuts the current between the battery and the board where it should, and that the battery management circuitry isn\u0026rsquo;t a dud, a problem like this is to blame. it can only be one: the banal old age of the battery.\nIn fact, not only was the battery visually quite swollen, but it has a date on the outside: \u0026ldquo;2015/8/27\u0026rdquo;, almost 8 years ago.\nI would swear that the keyboard itself is even older, considering the references to a slightly earlier era present on the box and the instructions: iPhone 4 and pre-7 iOS, Galaxy S4 and a visibly very old Touchwiz, Windows Mobile 6 and Windows 8 desktop, Symbian 3, the PS3\u0026hellip; well, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while.\nBad ending What can I say. Should I have expected a problem like this? Maybe yes. Surely, however, I doubt that other people in my place would have expected it.\nFinally, the only thing I can say is that this article should not have come out; or rather, not with this end. I should have talked about the already made Prototype 0 of my smartphone stand that adds this tiny keyboard, but, unfortunately, I feel like I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a chance to test it enough.\nHoping to be able to solve the battery problem (but I think so)1, in the next article, of what I believe will be a series, I will explain how I fixed everything, and I will illustrate the curious Prototype 0.\nUpdate 2023-03-21: I was passing by here, fixing some internal things in old files, and I thought: even if in the end I haven\u0026rsquo;t (yet) written any articles about Following this, at least one update note here is worth writing. Shortly after this post I soldered an old lithium battery I had around the house, more or less the same size, and\u0026hellip; the keyboard now works perfectly.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nA few months ago I bought a small monocrystalline solar panel online, with dimensions similar to those of an A4 sheet, for the figure of around ‚Ç¨20 (on Amazon.it the sellers are all thieves, on Aliexpress it would have cost a little less).\n![Screenshot of a photo sent in chat. The photo shows the panel in its cardboard box. The caption reads \u0026ldquo;‚ùóÔ∏è ENEL hates her! ‚ö†Ô∏è Find out how the Spacc Goddess began the slow but profitable path to energy independence! ‚û°Ô∏è @spacccraft\u0026rdquo;.](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Screenshots/ SpaccCraft-975.png)\nElectrical doubts The panel declared, in the title of the advert, a maximum output power of 7.8W.\nIt has a USB output port, clearly maximum 5V. Still in the details of the advertisement, but in the technical specifications, there were indicated 1A at 5V output\u0026hellip; which would be 5W.\nConsidering that the panel is declared to be 7.8W, and 5V photovoltaic cells do not exist, but 6V cells do, it is assumed that it should be able to output a theoretical maximum of 1.3A of current.\nThe output voltage, however, as we said, does not go above 5V, so a conversion is involved (impossible, considering that the panel itself is a slab less than 1mm thick, and the protruding part with the USB port will be just 15x10x5mm.. there is no space), or a trivial voltage truncation, where the excess energy does not translate into a greater output current, but only in little heat..\nAnd therefore we have a maximum theoretical output of 1.3A at 5V.. i.e. 6.5W.\nLife advice.. This preamble, apparently useless, is to remind us that low-cost cinema cameras with zero documentation (this thing doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a manual or writing on the back!) can only be trusted up to a certain point, beyond which to solve the problems In case of doubts, it is necessary to rely on the use of other china machines.\nIn my case, a USB multimeter, to be placed between the panel output and the input of a device capable of absorbing enough current. I don\u0026rsquo;t have this little object, and I realize that I would be wise to buy it (it\u0026rsquo;s cheap anyway), because at the moment I can\u0026rsquo;t have any certainty about the performance of the magical silicon slab.\nField tests Thanks to both the need to test the full possibilities of the small panel and the desire to make use of it to reduce my parents\u0026rsquo; electricity bill by 0.001% (and satisfy a tiny part of my individual electricity needs with totally clean energy), I so I started doing simple practical tests in the field (the balcony of my house).\nThe very first test To tell the truth, I did the very first test away from home, the day immediately after the product was delivered because, for unrelated reasons, I was actually away that day. On that occasion, the only one out for now, I only tried to recharge the battery of my smartphone (6000mAh).\nI did 3 different tests, the first two lasting about 15 minutes in the few hours before midday, when the sky was clear, with the panel held by me in my hand to make it better catch the sun perpendicularly (ideal for a monocrystalline).\nI first tried to charge the phone while it was on, stalled and with all the radios off (but not in Android\u0026rsquo;s deep sleep state), but unfortunately there was no way, the phone consumed so much energy that it was unable to recharge, it could only discharge slowly. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember very well, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t think of recording the data, but it seems to me that, on the app I use to see the charging statistics (AccA), only on the 300mA input.\nTrying the same formula immediately afterwards, but with the phone turned off, it seems to me that in 15 minutes it only charged 2% of the battery\u0026hellip; it would practically take 12.5 hours to charge from 0 to 100% if this is the case.\nI did the last test around 2pm, when the sky had unfortunately darkened. I placed the panel on a surface and used the phone normally, listening to music and I think using online messaging apps. As I suspected, it didn\u0026rsquo;t recharge, but at least it was almost without running out of charge, which is still good considering the weather conditions.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look further.. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s say that the very first test, outside with the phone, was a bit of a failure.\nHowever, without losing heart, in the following days I carried out other tests, all from the balcony of my house, some of which I will now give a rough overview of, because they were done once and with little data at hand.\nThe panel seems to be able to turn on my NodeMCU even with very little light, and I had no doubts about this, a microcontroller absorbs very little current, we are talking about tens of mA on average.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t tested any loads, but not that there can be any that big, the maximum you get with the NodeMCU is 250mA when you turn on the WiFi.\nOn a day with annoying clouds that come and go, another phone of mine (with a 3100mAh battery) manages to charge, but with difficulty, especially because when the phone enters or exits charging (and it happens in these light conditions), the screen turns back on and wastes energy.\nWhen turned off, it is even worse, because the screen always turns back on at maximum brightness and for longer. I found this last detail funny\u0026hellip; basically, charging the phone when it\u0026rsquo;s off in this way is worse than charging it when it\u0026rsquo;s on.\nOn a more or less OK day, but still a modest day at the end of winter - beginning of spring, I managed, in this case too, not to load but to download a little more slowly, my first generation Nintendo Switch console (the one with the least efficient SoC), with Ubuntu turned on and the software working.\nSomething that there is little to say about, but which is undoubtedly a victory, is that at least I can charge my power banks.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried 3 of my 4, clearly the smaller capacity ones load sooner, but in any case all of them fill up well without any problems. One that I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much it is, the memory would tell me 4000mAh, it recharges completely in just over a sunny day. A 5000mAh one, in maybe a day and a half.\nBy charging these small batteries you can then easily charge or power devices that do not have enough current if connected directly to the panel, such as my smartphones or\u0026hellip; a Rasperino.\nSolar Rasperino? We are finally at the end of all this ambaradan, with my tests on a Raspberry Pi 3B.\nThe idea popped into my head after I unfortunately left the magical product unused for a while, not knowing what useful things to do with it. I mean, I bought it because it\u0026rsquo;s definitely useful to have a little thing like this in emergencies, but if I can put it to good use in the meantime, that\u0026rsquo;s even better.\nI thought, first of all, of configuring BOINC on Raspbian, a distributed computing software that can be used to contribute to scientific research projects, while earning a few cents a month (rip) in a kind of cryptocurrency, the Gridcoin .\nAs I already said, the Raspino must be powered by the powerbank, the panel directly does not give it enough current. It seems to turn on, but in reality it seems to go into bootloop.\nWell, I won\u0026rsquo;t beat around the bush too much: while (with the same powerbank, I think 4000mAh) for some low-load applications, like Pwnagotchi, the Pi manages to stay on for hours even with a backlit LCD screen connected\u0026hellip; the CPU at 100%, doing complex calculations, eats so much of that current that the battery flattens out in just 1 hour.\nPsssss.. if you want to see other photos of the panel (3) and in a slightly more decent quality, I put them on Pixelfed: [pixelfed.uno/p/octo/426839557817260168](https://pixelfed.uno/p/ octo/426839557817260168)!\nThe reality of the facts Apart from this thing, which even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me money in practice would be useful as it is beneficial for scientific research, I have no practical uses in mind for the Rasperino Pi 3 Solare. Maybe a Pi Zero would be better: apparently, other people in the throes of madness (but better equipped) thought of using that to mine Bitcoin, with a small panel similar to mine ([YouTube/CbpfNU7oaws](https://invidious.snopyta .org/watch?v=CbpfNU7oaws)).\nFor now, I use the small panel sporadically to charge my power banks, which I discharge when I happen to use them around to charge my smartphone.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s anything I learned from this story, it\u0026rsquo;s that I should buy the damn USB multimeter.\nI should have done it almost 4 months ago, but instead I\u0026rsquo;m procrastinating so as not to spend money.\n","date":"June 23, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-06-23-%EF%B8%8F-Rasperino-Solare-and-other-experiments-gone-wrong/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s Web is unquestionably very different from that of 20 years ago, and it changes more and more with each passing year.\nLooking at the positive sides of progress is always very easy and reassuring, and for this reason we rarely think about the dark sides which, in many, many things, exist. The Web, unfortunately, is one of these.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s happening? The Web of documents is taking a turn for the worse, slowly becoming, to all intents and purposes, the Web of apps.\nTo understand the problem, however, we must remember what the World Wide Web was in its infancy. It was an Internet platform for exchanging information in the form of hypertext, that\u0026rsquo;s it. And what are hypertexts? Some documents. Of course, very particular documents, where reading can take place in a non-linear way thanks to hypertext links, and the Web in particular has evolved to be a hypertext system with support for decorated text, multimedia elements, and highly advanced layout\u0026hellip; but at the basically we always talk about documents.\nIn the very early days of the Web there were only so-called static sites, meaning they always remain the same (unless updated by those who administer them), and there is nothing that users who visit can do to change them. This category includes things like a simple blog, the site itself for example, a news site, the demonstration site of a company or product, an encyclopedia\u0026hellip; in short, simple things of this type.\nA little later (days or weeks, the idea was already envisaged in the very first specification of the Web and HTML) the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing servers that could process information entered by users with buttons and text fields, interact with database, and essentially provide a user-generated content experience. Therefore, forums in a more classic sense began to emerge, sites for creating sites (!) in a simpler way (CMS), the social networks closest to us, webchats and, let\u0026rsquo;s not forget, search engines. These are the dynamic websites.\nIn this period, however, it did not matter whether we were talking about static or dynamic sites, only documents returned to the computers of any user who contacted the site. Whether it was the HTML page itself, a CSS file to stylize the page, or multimedia files (at the time only photos) placed between one block of text and another, to the browser, the program that interprets and displays these documents, only documents to be interpreted returned, not programs to be executed.\nHere we are still in the exclusive existence of the Web of documents, for the Web of applications we will still have to wait.\nWith these last sentences, those who think ahead have already understood where I\u0026rsquo;m going with this, but I\u0026rsquo;ll get there calmly. In this era, essentially nothing much could happen to your computer or your information simply by loading a given Web page, because the browser only had to deal with files that told you how to lay out the text on the screen (HTML and CSS, markup languages), or how to arrange arbitrary colored pixels on the screen (images).\nThe only thing you had to trust was the browser itself (and that it was up to date), not individual websites.\nThe current state of affairs Then, came the scripting. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen all sorts of things, but in the end only JavaScript has survived to this day, and is the basis of the pioneering (and tragic) Web 3.\nOther Web scripts are actual programs that a browser can execute if loaded from a page. Here, however, an obvious problem arises: you have to trust every single website that integrates scripts, a problem that is however decidedly complex to deal with.\nTo be honest, this is not the only problem: scripts very often slow down pages, especially on older and less powerful devices, and on some very old stuff they don\u0026rsquo;t work at all, thus breaking sites that use them extensively. In practice, this means that sites that unnecessarily choose to integrate JavaScript are, on any hardware, often much slower than those that don\u0026rsquo;t.\nHowever, we will discuss this in detail another day.\nFirst of all, there are sites that upload obfuscated code, to all intents and purposes proprietary software\u0026hellip; those, only with a lot of patience and enough experience can you understand what they do. In any case, however, the simple fact that a program is free does not mean that it is necessarily free from privacy and security problems, and this has been seen, ironically, especially in the JS community, where developers of popular libraries have gone out of their way and integrated malware into their projects. Few open software developers put code that is harmful to users in their programs, but, those 2 or 3 out of 10000000 who do, sometimes get away with it, because there are no other people who bother to read the code and take action adequately.\nThis is a problem that concerns all users of the Web, and if those who already have the ability do not go, for obvious reasons of time and patience, to read all the code of the scripts loaded by all the sites they visit, imagine that those they just don\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to do it (the vast majority of users) are hopeless.\nMany people have problems - some sensible and some not, for those who know a minimum of how a modern computer works - installing native applications from scratch, perhaps never heard of before\u0026hellip; all problems that are ignored when you are simply browsing the Web, without knowing about the hundreds of scripts that run in a varied browsing session.\nHow can a script, and therefore a site that integrates it, be malicious?\nBrowsers today execute website scripts in a fairly sandboxed environment, of course, and as of today, for reasons that I won\u0026rsquo;t explain now, even serious flaws emerge every month, if you keep the browser updated the security is in theory fine.\nPrivacy, however\u0026hellip; that really ends up bad. There was a demo made as a game that showed personally why you need to be afraid\u0026hellip; too bad I can\u0026rsquo;t find it anymore, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember where I discovered it from, and therefore nothing :(. At the moment, for those who want to find out more , I can only link Device Info, which shows many of the data (but not all) that a website can extract from the devices of those who visit it. Maybe also take a look at Cover Your Tracks.\nThe problem here, it must be specified, does not lie in web apps that can be defined as real applications, which use JS to function. Whether it is a calculator, a game, a word processor, a photo editing app, we are always talking about applications, no matter whether they are written in native language as native apps for a specific platform, or whether they are written in JavaScript as applications for Web browsers. All of these things require the client to execute the code, because these are very interactive apps, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. I myself often use apps that run in a browser window.\nThere would then be a long discussion regarding the Web as an application development platform, for many reasons (even the flaws), positive and negative, but I will talk about it in the future.\nSmall digression: one way to quickly identify whether a service on the Web is conceivable as a document or necessarily only as an app, which I find intuitive, is this: just ask yourself (assuming there is no music or images): \u0026ldquo;the general content of this site would make sense if printed entirely on paper (even if it would no longer be hypertext), or not?\u0026rdquo; If the answer is yes, then we are talking about something that can easily remain as a document, and we must be wary of anyone who claims otherwise.\nDoes the content of a forum make sense if printed in a book, a magazine, or a simple leaflet (objects commonly considered documents, even if physical)? Certainly, as well as that of a blog, a social profile, a chat room, or the results page of a search engine.\nHowever, printing a calculator or word processing application makes no sense (at most, only printing data, entered into that app or obtained from its processing, makes sense).\nThe appization disaster The real problem lies in the fact that non-directly interactive websites, which we previously categorized into static and dynamic, are increasingly becoming apps, but without any valid reason.\nMore and more frequently I see more and more sites, which should be simple documents, not working properly without JavaScript. We go from news sites where the article doesn\u0026rsquo;t load, to blogs where the navigation menus no longer work, forums where message sections are not visible, forums that don\u0026rsquo;t load at all, new search engines that absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t work without JS ( and which present themselves as a private alternative to Google, it\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Google works well even without running proprietary scripts and these don\u0026rsquo;t!), and even social network sites that only show a blank screen if the JavaScript is not loaded.\nThese services that I have listed can all be classified as documents and, apart from very particular cases, such as those sites that encrypt and decipher client-side data deliberately to ensure that the server cannot read them (see [PrivateBin](https://privatebin .info) for a notepad, Element for a messaging app), can work fine without scripting and should (at least optionally).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like speaking against free and open software written in their spare time by enthusiasts, who perhaps don\u0026rsquo;t even earn money from it, but one thing that struck me negatively is that the plague of appization has also hit the Fediverse and its platforms.\nFor those who are unaware of this new virtual universe, I will say in short that it is an idea and, in practice, software, based on common protocols, to guarantee universal compatibility and interoperability, so that those on platform A can also communicate with those who are on\nMastodon and Friendica, at least for viewing profiles and their posts, or discussions with all messages, treat those who love the Web of pure documents well and, although their interactive applications do not work without JS (Mastodon totally, Friendica partially) even if they could, we are already at an excellent compromise.\nIf a person is not part of a certain instance, but wants to see content knowing the link, he can do it without fear, because he only has to load static documents in the trusted Web browser.\nThen there are other platforms, Misskey, Pleroma, and Pixelfed come to mind. These here, to allow you to view anything, require you to have JavaScript.\nMaybe you can even trust the authors of the software themselves, there are only the usual 10 around, but how can you trust when you find an instance you\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of before and managed by who knows who? Simple answer: you can\u0026rsquo;t; although in theory one could check which scripts the instance loads and whether they conform to the original version (or, in the case of a fork, whether the changes made are really the ones documented), no one will do so, for the obvious reasons of which we talked about before.\nThe problem of the unverifiable authority of the code, clearly, becomes even worse for individual websites, not necessarily based on any known finished software, and which therefore have no real counterpart to make a comparison regarding the state of the code.\nOn the Fediverse, I say that the question particularly strikes me because I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect it. Honestly, from Big Tech, which relies on spying on users to earn money by selling their data, I expect a progressive abandonment of the Web of documents in favor of that exclusively of apps even just for reading a few paragraphs of text (which is happening, but slowly), considering the very large potential to subjugate users.\nFrom those who develop software for communities who are concerned about some of the new privacy issues on the Web, and who therefore use less popular alternative software, I absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t expect it.\nIt will all end in tragedy The situation, I fear, can only get worse. Although I am more than sure that my words and actions will not change the future at all, given that I believe in what I say and, incidentally, at the same time I also create content and services for the Web, I do what I can to create my things as I would like to see them everywhere. So for non-interactive sites, following the progressive enhancement technique, I first make sure the basic stuff works without scripting, I use scripts the least possible and, if I really have to, I do it for optional functions and features, and I try to keep the code (within my limits) compact and readable.\nI personally appeal to you who are reading this.\nIf you build websites, consider taking what I\u0026rsquo;ve said into account, I beg you.\nIf, however, you only browse, perhaps try to start blocking JavaScript in your browser (Chromium integrates this as permission for sites, of which you can set the global setting to Blocked; on Firefox you must install [NoScript](https:/ /addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/noscript)), so as to keep JS deactivated for sites you don\u0026rsquo;t know, and have the possibility to activate it temporarily or permanently for domains that don\u0026rsquo;t work or that you already know and are aware of trust me. Not only will you browse more securely and privately, but with less slowdowns and loading!\n","date":"June 14, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-06-14-Documents-should-not-become-applications/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

There are those who will call me exaggerated for even having the thought of doing something like this, but there is little that can be done.\nIf nothing has gone wrong, the Onion service can still be reached at this address: onmfrk2acl4xdeawfjg3nfepq7gcufolctmhiwwxpcknazus5bxzxhqd.onion{: style=\u0026lsquo;Color:#a060c0;\u0026rsquo; } sitoctt2fxjvx3lc2iqqef2aeulflprjaasv2xl4zi7sxxbmvjy5b5yd.onion[^ New aesthetic domain].\nThe idea - apparently successful - was to use a free PaaS service, Replit, to do everything.\nThis way, I don\u0026rsquo;t further burden my improper server. For months now, precisely since the beginning of mid-February 2022, I have been using a Switch console as a server for too many things: in addition to the historic SpaccCraft server, I have my own Matrix instance, some Telegram bots which are perhaps the things that require the least resources, and software assorted minors. Yes, Nintendo Switch on which I started Ubuntu..\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go into details, it\u0026rsquo;s better to do it in a separate article, but in short the reason is that SBCs like the Raspini, to date, due to current world events, have scary costs, and the Switch was the only low-cost computer consumption with enough RAM (4GB) that I already had at home. You have to adapt.\nThis here is also the very first post I write on the postocto blog, who knows how it goes and above all who knows when it will appear, because I should fix my static site generator for a moment to be able to manage pages like this which, instead of common pages, should be treated as subpages of the \u0026ldquo;Blog\u0026rdquo; page (autogenerated).\nHow? Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the discussion of the postoctt: with Replit, taking as a basis a Repl found around that demonstrated how to host another type of service on Tor, I built my Repl which: at each new start, downloads locally everything needed to compile and deploy my static site (from my Git repos), prepare everything, and start an HTTP server and the Tor daemon, which acts as a proxy by exposing the HTTP server to the outside via the Tor network. Then endlessly, all through Git, download any updates to any of the parts and, when necessary, regenerate the site.\nI leave here the link to a GitLab snippet with my files, for anyone who wants to do the same service as me for their own website, perhaps built with my very low quality static site generator (at a code level, if it disgusted me on a conceptual or practical level I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be developing it slowly yet): gitlab.com/-/snippets/2338457.\nWith free PaaS services like Replit, however, there\u0026rsquo;s a little problem: there are limits on software execution times. In the case of this platform, everything goes into suspension if the project\u0026rsquo;s web address does not receive pings for I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand how many minutes. If it receives any later, it wakes up after the time necessary to redo the startup operations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a shame however that, apart from the fact that it would mean making anyone who wants to visit my site wait at least 30 seconds for the first connection to be established, it is the HTTPS address on the Replit domain that must be contacted, for obvious reasons not the Tor address. And having people connect via the HTTPS address defeats the purpose of having a Tor site (which I\u0026rsquo;ll get to shortly, I swear).\nThe solution would be to use, on a computer that is always on at home, a script or a cronjob (rather, a systemd timer, given that it is precisely because of systemd that classic cronjobs today are broken and malfunctioning) to continuously ping the address of the my site on Replit. I could do it, but I would like to find a way confined to the same free PaaS services to solve the problem, as something like this would mean that even those who don\u0026rsquo;t have a server at home can do what I did.\nInitially I tried with UptimeRobot, but it seems to be a problem, I set everything up in the evening, and the next morning my site was offline.\nSearching around I then found several sites (called \u0026ldquo;pingers\u0026rdquo;) that invite you to enter the address of your Replit project to make it ping continuously so as to keep it active. I used like 3 at random, that I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember, and since then the sitectt doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to turn off anymore.\nOr, perhaps, the merit was that I created a second Replit project, which has the sole purpose of pinging my first one endlessly (while the main one always pings the second one). I don\u0026rsquo;t know, because the second one seems to always shut down, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any exposed HTTP server, I have to investigate..\nWhy? Let\u0026rsquo;s immediately get the elephant out of the room (which is already small): the desire to set up a site that contains immoral material at serious levels (which I differentiate from illegal material per se), which if hosted on the traditional web would be very easy to tracing back to the owners with all the consequences of the case, is not the only sensible reason for wanting to use Tor (or any other network based on the same technical principles, but Tor is for better or for worse the most famous and used).\nThis site is also on the clear web without problems, that is, it has no problems being there.\nTor provides strong anonymity compared to the unfiltered Internet. The reason why it should be of interest to those who do not traffic in illicit content is quickly explained not with an answer, but with a question: do you happen to want to make known what you do (including visiting a particular website, like my blog) to multi-billion dollar corporations? that in return they will not give you anything, indeed they have no scruples about doing everything possible even to your detriment (tracking) to profit in one way or another?\nHow do you want your ISP to know about the particular Internet services you contact? Or have the person hosting those Internet services identify you (me and my ISP if it\u0026rsquo;s something hosted in my house, otherwise the particular provider for servers provided by companies, like Replit itself or GitLab.com where I host the site on the clear web ), if you won\u0026rsquo;t gain anything from it?\nFor many people, for some reason, this reasoning doesn\u0026rsquo;t add up, but few care and, although I don\u0026rsquo;t go to some extremes, I understand the points of view of the few people who want to maintain as much anonymity as possible even when they do moral and moral things. lawyers online. Accordingly, I agree with and encourage the use of Tor to access the services and content I provide.\nI still don\u0026rsquo;t convince you? So listen to this. Tor allows, for example, journalists who live under total or partial censorship regimes to report the truth, whether directly or not. Or, it allows those living in these regimes to inform themselves freely and uninfluenced by government propaganda, and to communicate with other people in other parts of the world.\nThe real principle that it is easier to hide who you are and what you do on an individual level in the midst of a huge crowd, rather than when you are with a few other people, also applies to distributed networks: more people use them, even for simple web browsing, the safer individual users are. So, by using Tor to surf the web, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t care about anonymity, you will help those in need.\nAt least help the users who don\u0026rsquo;t do anything wrong: the criminals who sell drugs and weapons, or sell photos and videos depicting rape or torture, often go to their heads, and end up neglecting the opsec to such an extent that sooner or later they end (and I would say that I enjoy this) more than badly.\nA doubt that may arise for non-super-experts, however, is why it is necessary to also provide the site as an Onion service, given that any content on the normal Internet is still accessible behind Tor, which in that case will work more like a traditional proxy . The problems here, however, are more subtle, and have to do with the nature of the classic Internet infrastructure.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I need to explain the problems arising from passing data in unencrypted form via the Internet: information can not only be stolen (which for a public blog is not a big problem), but even modified and presented as if nothing had changed, with disarmingly easy, from any of the intermediate parts of the connection, for example the ISP of the client or the server.\nHTTPS for websites solves this problem.. Bad. We don\u0026rsquo;t talk about it much, but the entire correct functioning of these protection systems depends on a complex global metaphysical infrastructure, which has more flaws than you might think.\nSearching on Whoogle, I found this PDF, which more or less gives a quick look at the problems HTTPS suffers from: [Weakest_Link_in_the_Chain.pdf](https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/archive/docs /Weakest_Link_in_the_Chain.pdf).\nWhat is essentially important to say is that the entire current system, based on CAs, consists of trust in an upstream authority. Without going into details, so I refer you to the PDF, the system is fragile and can be broken, resulting, in rare special cases, in the same problems as non-encrypted connections; indeed, perhaps even worse, because the presence of HTTPS can lead us to trust always and in any case: modern web browsers have conditioned us to ask questions only when we see the open padlock or a warning triangle, not when we see the closed shiny green padlock.\nWhen you use Tor to connect to sites on Tor, the connection is not only routed between even more nodes on the network, but the data is encrypted with a public and private key system between the client and the Onion service server: the only the weak point in the chain is the server itself, which stores the private key, there are no other authorities to trust.\nThe system has problems, I will absolutely not deny it, starting from the fact that if the private key is stolen, thieves can impersonate the site and at that point the only thing to do for those who manage it is to change the key, thus also changing the domain, you cannot go to the CA to revoke the certificate. This is how a system based 100% on mathematics and 0% on trust works.\nTo tell the truth, I would therefore be making a mistake in using someone else\u0026rsquo;s machine to host the Tor\u0026hellip; Greve site. Alright.\nIn conclusion Tor is by no means perfect: it has various types of flaws, generally based on the deanonymisation of users because that is what 3-letter agencies are interested in, but let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it clearly: it is a step forward towards having more protection, and it is certainly a huge step forward towards data security, in a way that ensures that communication between client and server is only as secure as server and client, without worrying about the minutiae introduced by any third party.\nThe fact that Tor is financially supported at least in part by the US government however, without going into too much detail, perhaps carries some profound dangerous implications. This is why I want, more or less soon, to give a chance to services similar to Tor but different from it. Lokinet inspires me, to tell the truth, I think it will be the first alternative network I try.\nüè∑Ô∏è Notes and References ","date":"June 3, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-06-03-%EF%B8%8F-How-and-why-sitectt-on-Tor/","section":"BlogüìöÔ∏è","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nOne thing I did months ago that, so far, has proven to be a winning choice, was install a Linux-based operating system, in persistent mode, * on* a small USB stick.\nThe reasons why I wanted to do it initially are perhaps simple and banal, but it gave me, upon careful analysis, some unexpected advantages that were much more than welcome.\nWhy was the pen needed? The initial need for the key arose months ago from the fact that, in the computer room at school, I had to, like everyone else, log in to my GSuite account to access the virtual computer class. This apparently simple thing, in my case, hid two obstacles:\nMy password is dozens of random characters long. I allow myself this because I use a password manager (for all my accounts), but typing by hand every time is painful; Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t trust the school\u0026rsquo;s IP address, and would ask me to confirm access, but as they haven\u0026rsquo;t added any security methods to the account, they ask me to add a phone number. Just because he asks it in this way, with a clear excuse, I will never give my number to Gluglu: it makes no sense, if bad guys stole my account username and password, they could simply verify the latter with their own number, and according to Google it will be clear that the account belongs to them\u0026hellip; but I won\u0026rsquo;t go further. I could have used any pen drive, with a portable Windows browser downloaded on it, containing my Google session saved from home, with access logged in with my IP address, and I would have solved the problem.\nI could have, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been fun.\nAnd this is where the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe key with an entire operating system emerged, bootable on any x86_64 PC, totally independently of the internal disk of the PC in question.\nChoice of hardware First, I thought about the memory I would use.\nIn terms of ability, I\u0026rsquo;d like to say that I did it just for the challenge, but the truth is that, on the few very large pen drives I have, I keep other files, which I have to keep on the pen drive, and moving them onto many small pen drives is annoying and brings to future confusion. So, I took one of my 2 GB pen drives, and I told myself that I would make do with it (and, spoiler, I was right, even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy).\nIn terms of speed, I only thought about avoiding stuff with levels lower than those of USB 2.0, because in any case I don\u0026rsquo;t have any fast stick available. My only stick with a USB 3.0 bus (correctly detected by Linux as USB 3.0) is as fast as a 2.0\u0026hellip; Damn Kingston.\nI have fast microSD cards, but my USB adapters for those cards are all slow.\nIn short, I take the trusty 2 GB USB 2.0 stick, mint color (it would be perfect as a Linux Mint installation media!), also from Kingston, and off I go.\nChoice of software Once you have chosen the stick, the choice of distribution Linux remains, perhaps even more important.\nHere, not only are the popular distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Pop!_OS, Manjaro, \u0026hellip;) too big to fit leaving room for a persistent partition, but they would be unusable due to the slowness of the stick.\nFortunately, I had a path in mind that I could follow, because, in the past months, out of my curiosity, I had learned something about the world of lightweight Linux distros.\nIt was a time when I had just become interested in Alpine Linux, for its ideals of lightness and minimalism. I even used it on desktop for a few weeks.\nIt was responsive and snappy, thanks also to the presence of musl libc instead of the now bloated [GNU libc](https://en.m.wikipedia .org/wiki/Glibc), but the need to sometimes configure small things by hand, even after the initial installation, led me to move away from it. However, I thought it would be suitable for a system installed on small, slow storage, with few applications.\nI then installed it, including among the essential software (as well as video and audio servers): Window Maker (a lightweight window manager), [Firefox](https:/ /firefox.com), and smaller GUI applications, including: a terminal emulator, a file manager, and a text editor.\nAll in all, it worked well and quickly but, despite the few apps installed, the memory was overflowing. This would give me some problems later: for example, there was no space to put Minecraft and play SpaccCraft, which I wanted because it can be useful.\nThis - together with the fact that later I thought that, perhaps, encrypting the pen drive would be necessary to protect my data against theft or loss of it, but my attempts to encrypt the already installed system failed - made me stop for a moment to reflect_.\nSince I would have had to reinstall the system anyway, I took the opportunity to change distribution.\nAlthough in the past, when I tried a little something, it had given me some trouble as a persistent system, I decided to give Puppy Linux a serious chance.\nThe base image of the latest version of Puppy (at the time of writing, 9.5) weighs just 400 MB, but includes a fairly complete desktop system in itself, with dozens of preloaded applications for the most varied needs.\nHow can it be so compact but full of stuff at the same time? Thanks to the use of SquashFS, a read-only compressed file system, which supports extremely efficient compression algorithms such as [LZ4](https:// en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)) and ZSTD. In fact, if it were completely decompressed, the image would weigh around 2.5 GB. Even the choice to include more minimal applications, however, contributes a lot, if you consider that practically all Linux live CDs use SquashFS, yet those of more traditional distributions weigh several GB.\nTo date Puppy is the distribution that I still have on the flash drive.\nExcept for a few minor problems (like: how the hell do I connect a Bluetooth keyboard??? and well, now I don\u0026rsquo;t need it anymore_), it works very well and is fast in every way.\nHaving set up the LUKS encryption on the writable partition, now my data (personal files and browser sessions) are protected against any accidents.\nThe built-in window manager, JWM, is also very clean and I quite like it - although I wish it had some window alignment function (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to has anything, or am I wrong?).\nAnd now, finally, I have enough free space; and I also have Minecraft!\nBackground credits: pixelartmaker.com/art/becdd8955dc57eb\nImportant benefits Well, with this magical little pen I have solved the problem of accessing Google, but I would continue to use it even if I no longer need it for that purpose.\nThe reasons, all important advantages, are as follows; some apply to live Linux in general (even amnesiac ones), others apply only to persistent systems like mine - all, however, are relevant when using a public PC:\nI have a system that adapts to my tastes, that I can carry in my pocket and use on any PC, without ever having to reconfigure anything (except, sometimes, the BIOS settings) . The system in question, contrary to what I could find on the vast majority of PCs around (Windows), respects my freedoms, and does not end up my data in the hands of a monopolistic corporation which, in exchange , it would give me absolutely nothing: on any PC I use, even those that aren\u0026rsquo;t mine, I remain consistent with my values. The secrecy regarding what I do on the PC at that moment is much more certain, as is the security of my data: you are only right to be wary of any operating system installed on public PCs, there could be any spy tool installed (and, in fact, this is the case on some of the PCs at school: there is a remote desktop control program designed for schools, [LanSchool](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/ wiki/LanSchool)). I have all my essential data always with me, whether they are simple documents or open sessions on different apps (like the always convenient Element, for messaging and exchanging notes and small files between my devices). Some particular software, such as Minecraft Java (which, apparently, may not work on some Windows PCs, because perhaps the GPU drivers do not work correctly, and Windows does not have the OpenGL emulation software from [Mesa] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_(computer_graphics)) system level, as opposed to Linux), should always work! I have an excuse to indirectly remind people that, even in 2022, USB sticks are relevant, even ultra-low-end ones. Some insights I can conclude by saying: you too should adopt a persistent Linux stick, if you sometimes use PCs that aren\u0026rsquo;t yours, you won\u0026rsquo;t regret it! In truth, I tell you, do it even just for fun, if you have some disused USB stick in a drawer :)\nHere are the websites of some distributions that I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention in the text, but which I have tried in the past or think are worth checking out:\nSpaccCraftGo - Puppy Linux rebranded from Spacc Inc, with the inclusion of SpaccCraft in the system; Slitaz - 50 MB live rolling release system; Porteus - Live distro based on modularity; antiX Slax üè∑Ô∏è Notes/References Update 2022-08-13: I imported this article from my old blog (\u0026lt;https://noblogo.org/loli-documentatrice/gli-inexpected-vantaggi- of the-linux-key\u0026gt;), to better preserve it and to test some things.

What follows is the archive of old content, which will remain readable. The new posts will then be published on the New Unified MicroBlog, accessible from the site menu.\nYou are venturing into a perhaps ephemeral section of the site, but in any case, if it exists, it means that I thought it should be there anyway.\nFollowing the idea that I have seen on (a few) other personal websites around the net, I dedicate this single page area to keep a so-called picoblog.\nIn practice, it is a flow of short, self-contained thoughts: often, an entire picoblog article is made up of just one sentence. For this fundamental detail, it differs not only from traditional blogs, where an article is often made up of many paragraphs, but also from the most popular microblogs today (√† la Mastodon), where an article is at most one paragraph.\n..Although, I think that, looking back at what I\u0026rsquo;ve written in the past 2 months\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s already more like yet another microblog, even if I try to limit myself as much as I can.\nMy idea is to create a more or less often updated flow of sentences that come to mind and I want to write. Who knows if browsing this page will help you get to know me better, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid not. In truth I would say, if you trust my normal blog 5, you have to trust -20 what you find here. Don\u0026rsquo;t take what I write here too seriously. Keep in mind that the most recent publications always go to the top, causing the previous ones to fall to the bottom. Furthermore, each article is collapsed by default for reasons of order, just click on the title to expand one.\nVarious things You can receive PicoBlog updates via Atom.

Of course, I hacked it right then and there. I said this on Mastodon, but I\u0026rsquo;ll do an in-depth post here sometime. However, this tablet adds to the list of strange devices on which I would like to make sure that the site works üò∂u200düå´Ô∏èÔ∏è\n[2022-07-10] The forgors üíÄ Apparently, for a healthy week I forgot my PicoBlog exists!

I figure if I start getting some, I\u0026rsquo;ll start forgetting less about updating the site in general, lmao xd\n[2022-07-03] But the comments? Eh eh, oops. The repo hasn\u0026rsquo;t had any new commits in weeks, dead. What a drag. However, with the ActivityPub integration that the site has now had for 2 days, there is already a sort of comment system for every single post on the blogocto.. so is my job done?\n[2022-07-01] The Octocapsule! And from today the octocapsule, that is, my Gemini capsule, also exists on the Internet. For now, there you will only find a 1:1 conversion of the sitectt, but, if you want to know further, I refer you as usual to Home # Site Availability.\n[2022-06-30] More than a generator By now, this is what static is becoming, contrary to my own expectations. Just now I started implementing 2 wacky things: Gemtext generation (expect the sitectt on Gemini..), and publishing new posts on ActivityPub (Mastodon).\n[2022-06-29] Mining Tor domains That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I did! In what sense? This is simply what you do with a program like mkp224o, if you want to obtain an address containing particular characters. The new address, which begins (this is the peculiarity) with \u0026ldquo;sitoctt\u0026rdquo;, is linked on [Home # Site Availability](./index.html#- Site-availability).\n[2022-06-27] Always new here Now I have a page Collection of Internet Sites where I link to other nice sites, I created an 88x31 PNG that identifies my site and that anyone who wants can use it to link it.. well come on, little by little it\u0026rsquo;s filling up even better than a simple blog :D\n[2022-06-26] Yet another ActivityPub platform Yep, there\u0026rsquo;s already a new one in beta since practically yesterday. That its archetype is Mastodon can be seen immediately, but Bonfire promises a different philosophy (?) and\u0026hellip; the developers give a damn about progressive improvement, and a large part of the app already works without JS! This alone is enough to make me rejoice.\n[2022-06-24] Atom/RSS Feed Statistico finally integrates the generation of Atom/RSS feeds! If everything works, I will write the information on Home # Feeds and notifications, but the metadata is already present in the HTML, so using a browser that still integrates an aggregator feed, like SeaMonkey, a subscribe icon should appear.\n[2022-06-22] The exaggeration I felt like going overboard and implementing a visit counter on the site. Luckily, I found the ready-made free service of contatoreaccessi.com, which works by loading absolutely zero JavaScript, even if it also counts refreshes, not unique visits.. alright.\n[2022-06-21] Technical updates Between yesterday and this morning I worked quite a bit on the generator, to fix little problems and add functions, and I added some improvements to the CSS of the site. However this PicoBlog is now just a devlog, a bit of a shame, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know what else to write that\u0026rsquo;s very short.. üòÖ\n[2022-06-20] Epic domination After a month, eu.org gave me the domain I asked for\u0026hellip; soon the site will be navigable from sitoctt.octt.eu.org! Technically already reachable, but I have to fix some generator problems, if I want the current domain not to break..\n[2022-06-19] Division into categories In the end I think I achieved something the way I wanted it. Now in the navigation bar of the site there is a \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo; section, which is nothing more than a semi-automatic list of categories.\n[2022-06-18] Comments on the sitectt For a few days now I have been working almost continuously on my own comment system to enable for the site. It\u0026rsquo;s not finished yet and I don\u0026rsquo;t know when I\u0026rsquo;ll finish it (and if I finish it.. let\u0026rsquo;s hope I don\u0026rsquo;t throw it all away out of boredom).\n[2022-06-14] I would like a category system.. ..that I don\u0026rsquo;t really know how I want it either. Aside from the categorization of Blogocto posts into themes, I would like the themed collection pages to also include pages that are not strictly posts, but I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it would create confusion. I\u0026rsquo;ll think about it for a long time\u0026hellip;\n[2022-06-07] Robine Tor Since Tor Browser at the maximum protection setting, set by many people who use it, breaks some CSS components (there is no JS) of my site\u0026hellip; I updated the generator to support the addition of a header section on all the pages, at the time of site build. I posted information about the problem there.\n[2022-06-03] The first blogocto post! I started writing it 3 days ago, then between one thing and another I only had the opportunity to finish writing today, both the article in question and the code for my generator that manages the blog-style posts (on which I still have to make arrangements). Go see it here!\n[2022-05-30] Maremma good this generator Developing this site builder is proving to be a mystical experience, both good and bad. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know how to describe it all, it\u0026rsquo;s absurd.\n[2022-05-29] The site on Tor Finally, I also set up a Tor mirror of the site! You can find it linked on Home # Site Availability. Now everything is safer and more private.\n[2022-05-27] Try This article is just a test, maybe it will be deleted.\n[2022-05-27] The PicoBlog begins! What is this post for?

Or rather, it was a period in which I was interested in the concept of using paper as a means of storing small computer data, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I started to feel this taste.\nFrom there, I had a particularly specific idea: to store small programs or demos on equally small paper cards. I immediately opted (and I still consider it a good choice) for the Western European business card format, i.e. 85x55 millimetres: it is standardized and elegant, with a good rectangular area and a good ratio between one and \u0026lsquo;other side. I can collect and store these cards as if they were business cards (or distribute them as such!), in binders that are easy to find and highly convenient to use. I\u0026rsquo;m just sorry it\u0026rsquo;s not part of the metric card system!\nRemembering MattKC\u0026rsquo;s feat of fitting a little game into a QR Code, I opted for this storage format. I knew and know others for saving data on sheets of paper, but they are all less ideal, for different combinations of the following reasons:\nThey are optimized for large sheets, and are not suitable for small cards, where they would be less efficient. They have a lower storage density than QR Codes, because they exist for different purposes. In theory they are promising, but in practice they do not have a working software implementation (and, therefore, there is no physical way to use them). Finally, QR Codes are definitely easier to read with better or worse hardware and software:\nHardware: a simple webcam is enough, integrated into a smartphone (ideal, they are generally of higher quality) or a PC. Software: there are many QR code decoding software; some smartphones even integrate them into the system. \u0026hellip;WIP.
