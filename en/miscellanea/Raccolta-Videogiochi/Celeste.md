Celeste is a nice little platformer game, with original mechanics and a unique graphic style. But it's too difficult.  
I tried to play it many times, but at a certain point in the story the difficulty became too high for me. I should maybe try finishing it in guided mode, since the option is there. Until I've done it, though, I'm not going to look for videos of the ending and spoil stuff, since they say that the value of Celeste lies precisely in its meaning.
