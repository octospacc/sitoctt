<h1><span class="twa twa-ðŸ”‹"><span>ðŸ”‹</span></span> Everything to avoid changing two batteries...</h1>

<p>Between <strong>1 and 2 months ago</strong> - realize <strong>how much time</strong> passed <strong>before</strong> I <strong>got annoyed</strong> definitively - the <strong>batteries in the remote control</strong> of the <strong>television</strong> that I keep on my <strong>desk</strong> (I use it as a second monitor) have <strong>started to run out beyond the limit</strong>of tolerable usability.</p>

<p><img src="[staticoso:CustomPath:Assets]/Media/Misc/Remote-Mini-Batteries.webp" alt="The remote control on my desk, with the battery compartment open, and a lot of mini batteries stylus colored around."></p>

<h2>Because I didn't do anything</h2>

<p>Up until now <strong>I haven't changed them</strong>, simply because I was getting annoyed and <strong>dry</strong>, considering that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have relatively <strong>few rechargeable pen and mini-stylus batteries, and I have to save them for the stuff that really draws a lot.</li>
<li><strong>I don't want to waste</strong> non-rechargeable batteries and contribute to, in order:

<ol>
<li>The waste of <strong>house</strong> money;</li>
<li>The global waste of <strong>materials</strong>;</li>
<li>The waste of <strong>energy</strong> for the transport - and, when possible, recycling - of these materials;</li>
<li>Ultimately, the <strong>pollution</strong> of the planet.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The batteries in the remote control <strong>still work</strong>, <strong>although</strong> in a decidedly <strong>not optimal way</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technically "it works"</h3>

<p>The <strong>remote control</strong>, in fact, proves that it can <strong>still send signals</strong> to the television, but only <strong>for a moment</strong>: just long enough to press <strong> >a button</strong>, and nothing more. In an instant he returns dead, and immediately trying to send other signals is of no use.<br>
If, however, at this point <strong>you wait</strong> for about fifteen seconds, and <strong>then you press</strong> another key, the command <strong>goes to sign</strong>. It is clear that the <strong>batteries</strong> are very discharged, but they still have that little charge that allows a <strong>capacitor</strong> to charge <strong>slowly</strong>, and therefore at <strong>remote control</strong> to be <strong>powered</strong>. <strong>Emitting</strong> the <strong>infrared</strong> light then apparently drains all the charge from the capacitor in a few moments, and then you have to wait again for it to recharge.< /p>

<h2>What do I need it for on my desk?</h2>

<p>Honestly, <strong>I don't need the remote control</strong> anyway. <strong>98%</strong> of the time I only use it to <strong>turn the appliance on or off</strong>; those very few other times when I need to adjust the volume, or change the active source, I can easily use my <strong>smartphone</strong>, on which I have an application that uses the emitter <strong>integrated infrared</strong> (that's right, producers don't integrate it <em>only</em> as a means of playing pranks in places open to the public, but also as a <strong>useful</strong> tool). </p>

<h3>For when I have to do it immediately!</h3>

<p>The problem, big problem, when I have to <strong>turn on and off</strong>, is that I need <strong>quick access</strong>.<br>
<strong>I can't start</strong> to unlock the phone, look for the application icon for the remote control, and then press firmly on the display to center the power button, all with <em>easy pigs</em> > of my Android ROM, which is buggy and slow, as if it were <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Only%20in%20Ohio" rel="noopener nofollow" target= "_blank">from Ohio</a> (instead it is from developers in India, like virtually all Android <em>custom ROM</em>s).</p>

<h2>The controls on the back</h2>

<p>The <strong>TV has</strong> an integrated <strong>control interface</strong>: a simple <strong>wheel</strong> that moves in two directions and you press, and you can use to <strong>turn on/off</strong> or change source.<br>
The problem is that it is in a <strong>terrifying position</strong>! It is practically on the <strong>side of the rear edge</strong>, the one formed by the continuation of the plastic structure, which maintains the television circuitry, behind the LCD frame.<br>
Practically <strong>I would have to bend over</strong> every time, sticking my fingers between the annoying obstacles that live on my desk.</p>

<p>Maybe I should be <strong>thankful</strong> that those controls are on the <strong>left edge</strong> - since I have the other screen immediately to the right, things <strong>could have been worse</strong> strong> - and be satisfied... <em>what balls... piles</em>... no, <strong>balls!</strong></p>

<h2>My solution</h2>

<p>And so, for this <strong>outdated art attack</strong>, I take the following materials and tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>pliers</strong> (absolutely not made for bending metals, but I have this), to bend:

<ul>
<li>An old <strong>paper clip</strong>, of medium thickness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scissors</strong> (with non-rounded tips), for cutting:

<ul>
<li>The <strong>card</strong> of the Amazon packages.</li>
<li><strong>Double-sided adhesive</strong> tape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Hilarious process</h3>

<p>So here's what I went to do:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>I bend</strong> a <strong>terminal</strong> part of the <strong>paperclip</strong> to form a small <strong>ring</strong>.

<ul>
<li>It serves to <strong>accommodate</strong> the protruding central part of the <strong>wheel</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A little at a time, I <strong>take</strong> the <strong>measurements</strong> that the paperclip must have, and <strong>bend</strong> it accordingly:

<ol>
<li><strong>I place</strong> the paperclip <strong>on the wheel</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>I see how long it is</strong> at the first new detachment point it reaches on the TV body;</li>
<li>I take it again, holding the point of interest with my finger, and patiently <strong>fold</strong> it;</li>
<li><strong>Repeat until</strong> the paperclip reaches the <strong>front edge</strong> of the television, passing over the side one.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I notice that the protrusion of the wheel ends completely inside the ring, which therefore does not press it; then I <strong>fit</strong> a small piece of <strong>cardboard into the ring</strong> (optionally blocked with adhesive tape).
<img src="[staticoso:CustomPath:Assets]/Media/Toshiba-TV-Button-Hack/Clip.webp" alt="The paperclip, bent almost completely to be mounted."><br>

<ul>
<li>In this way, something <strong>solid pushes</strong> exactly on the wheel, which is actually pressed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since everything seems fine to me, I start cutting <strong>cardboard strips</strong>, and attaching some <strong>double-sided tape</strong> to the ends.

<ul>
<li>These are to <strong>support the paperclip</strong> in different points, and not let it fall away from the button, but leaving it <strong>freedom of movement</strong> in one direction.

<ol>
<li>About halfway I leave the strips clean, and crease them slightly, to leave a <strong>space</strong> in which to <strong>pass the metal wire</strong>;</li>
<li>Keeping the paper clip in the right position, I attach the strips where necessary.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>What a job...</h3>

<p>As regards <strong>pressing the button</strong> - which I can now implement <strong>by placing my finger on the extreme left edge</strong> of the screen, without having to put my hands behind everything - this solution <strong>works perfectly</strong>.<br>
Alas, the <strong>rotation</strong> of the wheel is not good with this <em>crotch</em>, which has good freedom of movement on only one axis. In any case, the cardboard does not create excessive rigidity, so <strong>I can still</strong> rotate the wheel <strong>from behind</strong>.</p>

<p>That's it. If <strong>I were to improve</strong> my solution - which, yes, is <strong>very crude</strong>, I won't deny it because this is <strong>what I like</strong> - <strong>I will write an appendix</strong>to this article.</p>

<h2>Awkward questions</h2>

<p>I already know that the <strong>question will come</strong>, so I'll answer now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>But all those loose batteries you put in the cover photo?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ehhh. Good question.<br>
They are all <strong>batteries</strong> that I <strong>keep</strong> when they are discarded at home (not by my hand, since, I repeat, I avoid non-rechargeable ones as much as possible). , because very often "discharged" just means "too discharged for the device from which it was replaced". <strong>For some remote controls, in fact, they often <strong>still work</strong>, including mine in some cases.</p>

<p>So did I just <strong>waste time</strong> with today's project? Nah, <strong>I wouldn't say</strong>: from now I can easily <strong>keep the remote control</strong> a little more <strong>put</strong> away, no longer necessarily always on the <strong>desk</strong> strong>, which I can therefore keep <em>very lightly</em> (because in an instant I ruin my own efforts!) <strong>more tidy</strong>.</p>
