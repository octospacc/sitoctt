# üî¢Ô∏è 2048

**2048** is a simple puzzle game in which you have a grid of randomly generated numbered tiles that you can slide entirely in one of four directions. All numbers are powers of 2, and equal numbers that collide add to become their double.

* If you reach 2048 by adding up the tiles, you **win** a game, which however can go on even further.
* **You lose** if you end up filling the grid entirely with numbers without having room to make other moves.

The official implementation of the game is open source, which has led to the creation of many clones and modified versions that implement the most varied mechanics.

...**WIP**... If you want to find out more about the game, read on [Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/2048_(videogame)){[:MdTgtBlank:]}.
