A collection dedicated to some nice Internet sites (not just web!), of various types, that I find around or belong to people I know.

Apart from the division into categories, there is no particular order.  
The country flags (emoji, perhaps not visible on older browsers) next to the names indicate the primary languages ​​of the site's content.

_These above are the sites in the list that have an 88x31 button. Do you also want the privilege of being at the top? So go ahead and draw this little picture, come on!_ -->

## My..

If you like my site, and you also have one with a page similar to this list where you want to recommend it, you can link it, as a text link or even as an 88x31 button!  
Below are the HTML codes that you can copy and paste.  
(_They are formatted in a **special** way because wrapping can cause spacing problems in the display; the only alternative to what I did would be to leave everything on a single line._)

Text link:  
✨sitoctt✨  
```html
<a
	href="https://sitoctt.octt.eu.org"
	target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"
>✨sitoctt✨</a>
```

Link with image _(Note: it would be better if you download the image and upload it back to your server, changing the URL in the code accordingly, rather than using my URL)_:  
![✨sitoctt✨]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/Sites/sitoctt-1.png)  
_The image is in PNG format and already compressed as much as possible.[^PNG Lossless Compression Commands]_  
```html
<a
	href="https://sitoctt.octt.eu.org"
	target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"
><img
	style="image-rendering:pixelated; -ms-interpolation-mode:nearest-neighbor;"
	alt="✨sitoctt✨" title="✨sitoctt✨"

## Personal

- **🇮🇹 Arcisito**  
![arcisito]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/88x31/Sites/arcisito-1.png)  
As you can read from the site name and domain, it is the Arci (or also Aurora) site. She set it up today (2022-06-30), after she said she didn't know what to do with all the summer free time, and I said "be an Archsite".  
	• Clearweb: [arci.me](https://arci.me) <!-- [auroraviola.eu.org](https://auroraviola.eu.org) -->

- **🇬🇧️ 🇮🇹️ Gianmarco Gargiulo**  
![serimemo]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/88x31/Sites/gianmarco.gg-gmgpin.gif)  
Site with a modern layout, but decidedly creative design, with an artistic side well expressed in the illustrations. The home page serves as a list of the content archive, and the different types are illustrated in the most appropriate format. Very Linux and free software focused, but the drawings and photos look great.  
	• Clearweb: [gianmarco.gg](https://gianmarco.gg)

- **🇬🇧 Thushi's lair**  
Ultra-minimal site, no graphics (:'c), but nice (3) color scheme and nice content.  
	• Onion web: [m4vojazxsxvaxfoeklmq6na546fd5hjyo3zrgeq45cixdfm6kodkhdid.onion](http://m4vojazxsxvaxfoeklmq6na546fd5hjyo3zrgeq45cixdfm6kodkhdid.onion)

- <b id="-s-a-1">🇬🇧 🇮🇹 astral town</b>  
![serimemo]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/Sites/serimemo-88x31.png)  
Colorful and welcoming site, well there's nothing else to say.  
	• Clearweb: [astral.town](https://astral.town)

- **🇮🇹 Ribby's Workshop**  
The theme of this site really gives me a workshop feel, so to speak. Few frills but it has its own style, and its division into categories was a partial inspiration for what I have on my site now.  
	• Clearweb: [officinadiribby.altervista.org](https://officinadiribby.altervista.org)

- **🇬🇧 daedalOS**  
Modern web document viewers (browsers) are an excessive platform, where absurd things can be done. Like a real (free) **operating system**, created by _Dustin Brett_, for portfolio. **Madness**.  
	• Clearweb: [dustinbrett.com](https://dustinbrett.com)

- **🇬🇧 Fra/Website**  
More than a site, a JavaScript demo with a list of links and stuff, but it's unique. I won't say anything else, better to see for yourself!  
	• Clearweb: [francescomasala.me](https://francescomasala.me)

- **🇬🇧 🇮🇹 Tassoman's homepage**  
Just a main page and not much other stuff, but just the idea of ​​the site is an experience.. **interesting**. The only site I've seen so far that uses a precise Apache configuration, with the exact purpose of slowing the site down to speeds of 14.4 kbps!  
	• Clearweb: [tassoman.com](https://tassoman.com){.tassoman}

- **🇬🇧 Ledomsoft**  
Site resurrected from the author's archives from more than a decade ago, programmed as it was done back in the day. Nice colorful with GIFs and all, but moderate, not without restraint.  
	• Clearweb: [ledomsoft.com](https://ledomsoft.com)

- <b id="-s-a-2">🇬🇧 Dante Scanline</b>  
![Dante Scanline]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/Sites/DanteScanline-88x31.png)  
Site of an artist who seems to make stuff in the style of 90s-2000s PC games, like Quake but not only. The images of pixelated 3D environments are very beautiful.  
	• Clearweb: [dantescanline.com](https://dantescanline.com)

- <b id="-s-a-3">🇬🇧 2Bit</b>  
![2Bit]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/Sites/2Bit-88x31.png)  
I believe it is the only non-textual website that can be navigated on Kindle (almost) exactly like on a PC. As the name itself says, everything on this web space is a tribute to the 2-bit era, and it achieves this with the contents, but it starts with the form: all the graphics (and there are a lot of them) are strictly in 4 colours!  
	• Clearweb: [2bit.neocities.org](https://2bit.neocities.org)

- <b id="-s-a-4">🇬🇧 neonaut</b>  
![neonaut]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/Sites/neonaut-88x31.png)  
Personal site with colorful flat graphics, which however also seems to be a metasite about Neocities and a part of its culture, containing some information about that universe.  
	• Clearweb: [neonaut.neocities.org](https://neonaut.neocities.org)

## Miscellaneous

- <b id="-s-a-5">🇬🇧 The Yesterweb</b>  
![Yesterweb]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/Sites/Yesterweb-88x31.png)  
Collective site that refers, conceptually and visually, to the Web of days gone by and its best sides, to which it promotes returning.  
	• Clearweb: [yesterweb.org](https://yesterweb.org)

- **🇬🇧 XXIIVV**  
I don't really understand what this site is, what it is for, who manages it, and everything else. But it has nice graphics and I like it.  
	• Clearweb: [xxiivv.com](https://xxiivv.com)

- <b id="-s-a-6">🇬🇧 OpenBooks</b>  
![OpenBooks]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Buttons/Sites/OpenBooks-88x31.gif)  
Movement, and library of sites and resources, which promotes a modern rebirth of the personal Web. The site even has nice graphics.  
	• Clearweb: [openbooks.neocities.org](https://openbooks.neocities.org)

- **🇬🇧 LOW-TECH MAGAZINE**  
This site periodically publishes articles about the world of low-scale technology, to explore how forgotten technologies of the past can prove not only useful today, but also more suitable than modern solutions for some situations.  
	• Clearweb: [lowtechmagazine.com](https://lowtechmagazine.com)  
In addition to the main version, which appears like a very common blog, there is also a _more low-tech_ version. This, residing on a server powered by solar energy, aims to drastically reduce the energy consumption necessary to access the contents; and on a technical level, the optimizations implemented are decidedly interesting!  
	• Clearweb: [solar.lowtechmagazine.com](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com)

## Culture

- **🏳️‍🌈 EverybodyWiki**  
A wiki open to anyone who wants to create articles on any topic, and without the stringent standards of more serious collaborative encyclopedias like Wikipedia: there are no standards of quality, nor of usefulness, as I understand it. Precisely because of the very smooth rules, I don't know how much it can be a reference point for anything, but it's an interesting concept. It is divided into subwikis for different languages, and also attempts to preserve articles marked for deletion from Wikipedia.  
	• Clearweb: [🇬🇧 en.everybodywiki.com](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Everybodywiki:Welcome)

- **🇬🇧 FEMICOM Museum**  
A virtual museum dedicated to illustrating those rare computer and videogame contents that make feminine, colorful and kawaii aesthetics and experiences their key point. Unfortunately, not all the pages are filled, but what little there is is nice!  
	• Clearweb: [femicom.org](http://femicom.org)

- **🇷🇺 🇬🇧 Encyclopedia Game Boy Advance**  
It's a nice site that I found by chance, which collects various information on the Game Boy Advance from different points of view. It is well organized and has many photos to support the textual material. It is available in English, but the main Russian version has much more content.  
	• Clearweb: [🇷🇺 gbasp.ru](https://gbasp.ru), [🇬🇧 en.gbasp.ru](https://en.gbasp.ru)

[^Lossless PNG Compression Commands]: The best way to reduce PNG images to the smallest possible size, without losing even a single pixel of quality, is to use these two commands together (keeping in mind to evaluate on a case-by-case basis, as images already very small can actually in certain cases be inflated by one or the other command):
