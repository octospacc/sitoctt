The premises were creative, but boring: you are a human being who, for some reason, goes on a journey to settle in a village where humanoid animals live with whom you can interact. In the meantime, you have to get into debt with a raccoon who sells you the new house at a very high price, and do what you can to repay, with times that can become infinite. Ah, if you want you can choose your clothing, furnish your house, place flowers in the garden... and?  
Animal Crossing is one of those games that simply needs to be tried to be understood: staying in that world manages to induce calm and joy for reasons that apparently go beyond logic.
