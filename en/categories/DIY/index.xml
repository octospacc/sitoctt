      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Between 1 and 2 months ago - realize how much time passed before I got annoyed definitively - the batteries in the remote control of the television that I keep on my desk (I use it as a second monitor) have started to run out beyond the limitof tolerable usability.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Ahhh, and here we are in November again this year. I would say that it is time to start the necessary procedure of thawing the Padoru.&#xA;...No, wait a minute. IT&#39;S ALREADY MID DECEMBER?!?!?! 😐 😶 🤯&#xA;The months pass quickly... oh well.&#xA;What is &#34;Padoru&#34; For many a controversial issue and a despised custom, that of the Padoru.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;For almost 7 years I have had an Acer laptop, Aspire V3-572G, undoubtedly now a bit old, without praise and with some infamy.&#xA;When it was purchased, it was essentially a mid-range notebook like any other, without any notable features.
