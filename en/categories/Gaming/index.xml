      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Just the day before yesterday, a game jam ended, that is, an (online) video game development competition based on creating something using RPG Maker 95, a very old version of the series in question. game engines. ...It wasn&#39;t well publicized, it seems? Because searching on the web I can&#39;t find a shred of an announcement page or one that collects the jobs.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Those who have been following my adventures for long enough and with due attention perhaps know this, but the biggest problem in computer science is: how to properly reconcile the discrepancies that are created when we face the problem of playing video games both at home than in portability?</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Note: This article should have first explained the Switch dock issues, but then continued and ended with &gt;total development of my alternative solution. The first part was quite long, however, and I&#39;m afraid that it might eclipse the really important part, that of my dangerously original solution. So, in this article I only talk about my problems; what comes out later will be dedicated to my do-it-yourself.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;I believe Minecraft can be defined as the modern game (for better or worse) that develops potentially infinite complexity from simple premises. In a good way, obviously: complexity impresses and rewards those who seek it, but the title remains playable for anyone.&#xA;At first it&amp;rsquo;s making &amp;ldquo;houses&amp;rdquo; that are 4x4 holes under the ground, but later it becomes creating titanic installations, purely aesthetic or even totally functional - let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that Minecraft, with its redstone, is Turing-complete.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;From YouTube/2N1TJP1cxmo.&#xA;The best way to describe Mirror&amp;rsquo;s Edge is to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a game in constant motion. Literally standing on the edge of the mirror, the edges of the enormous glass of which the buildings of La Citt√† are made, one runs and jumps without any brakes.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;In Minesweeper (in Italian officially &amp;ldquo;Minefield&amp;rdquo;) you have a game grid in which bombs have been randomly placed (by an algorithm). To win, you need to locate them all without exploding any of them.&#xA;The rules are simple, but the game easily reaches high levels of complexity and has an I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-what that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;2048 is a simple puzzle game in which you have a grid of randomly generated numbered tiles that you can slide entirely in one of four directions. All numbers are powers of 2, and equal numbers that collide add to become their double.&#xA;If you reach 2048 by adding up the tiles, you win a game, which however can go on even further.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Why not make a collection to talk, briefly, about the video games I appreciate? Perhaps, managing to shine the spotlight on some half-unknown gaming experience which however should deserve much more. And it cannot be excluded that in the future, finding inspiration, I could take and write long and in-depth articles on some of the games that I always praise briefly here, to start with.</description>

Enough, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to say anything else; after all, among connoisseurs, we understand each other. A console that, 15 years ago, was able to innovate the market with the same spirit with which the Gameboy innovated in its time. A console whose exclusives remain, even today, timeless pearls.</description>
