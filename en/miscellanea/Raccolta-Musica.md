- <span><h3>Macross 82-99</h3></span>  
Mainly music from the future-funk genre, a subgenre of vaporwave with a more rhythmic and nicer tone. Each album has different sound themes, with references to Japanese pop culture of the 80s and 90s. More or less all of his songs manage to be very calm and relaxing.

- <span><h3>Moe Shop</h3></span>  
Mostly lively songs, with an anime atmosphere, so to speak. I think the album covers go very well with his music. Some of his pieces have less playful sounds and characteristics closer to more common types of electronic music, but I still manage to appreciate them a lot.

- <span><h3>Ujico / Snail's House</h3></span>  
I knew they were the same person, but I didn't know that "Ujico" and "Snail's House" were actually characters with different identities<sup>[[?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail's_House #History)]</sup> regarding the musical composition. I was initially introduced to his music, at least some of it future-bass, made under the name Snail's House. There you can see his current style, whose kawaii electronic sounds I have always liked. Later, I discovered his previous albums, which in terms of expressiveness are oriented more towards the complex of the music itself, and not the small details. Two very different ways of creating a genre of music, with different settings, but both with the same magnificent personal tone.
