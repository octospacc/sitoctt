Some will know, in Italy the **new anti-piracy law** has been **approved**, and now the **doubts** that we enthusiasts of free sharing have to deal with are different:

* When will it come into force? (I hope not exactly at the time I'm writing this post üò∞)
* How much money will the entertainment lobbies have spent to ensure that the law was passed with total unanimity?
* What **real consequences** will this bring to us **ordinary citizens**?

## Blocks (instant and per IP)

The point that perhaps struck me most about the law (here [the PDF examined by the Commission](https://documenti.camera.it/leg19/pdl/pdf/leg.19.pdl.camera.217_A.19PDL0028100.pdf) , and [the final report](https://temi.camera.it/leg19/dossier/OCD18-17872/disposizioni-contrasto-illecita-trasmissione-o-diffusione-diretta-e-della-fruizione-illegale-contenuti- protected-by-right-d.html)) - perhaps because I own various online properties, totally personal, which have zero economic value for me, but unquantifiable sentimental value - it is the **obligation for the providers** of Internet services to respond to **instant block requests**.

A **copyright** holder can send a **blackout request** which, when it is **urgent** - think of a live sports match, which is being illegally rebroadcast in real time - must be honored in **no later than 30 minutes** by all providers, without **any adversarial or formal process**: it will be **the owner** of the blocked website who will then have to open legal proceedings for * *dispute the block** and request reinstatement.  
For illicit sites, all **domain and subdomain names** (DNS), and **IP addresses**, present and, I have no idea according to what limits, all possible future ones are blocked.

### The new responsibilities

By "suppliers" we do not mean only telephone operators, who provide the connection to the Internet, but in general those "**involved in any capacity in the accessibility**" of illegal services, and explicit reference is even made to ** search engines**.

Search engines do nothing other than return _links_ accompanied by a description, and actually **do not** directly provide **pirated material**: in practice, this law even aims to **hinder those who only provide links**, not just those who allow the downloading of data physically.

For this logic, the managers of **_social networks_** will also be held **responsible** (and I imagine that "information society" in the text refers precisely to them), and possibly **small communities* * online.

### An expensive firewall

The **potential for abuse and errors** is very high, and in fact, viewed impartially, this move can in any case be summarized as the **obligation** for ISPs to **build a [mega-firewall] (https://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-mega-firewall-could-render-italian-isps-liable-for-over-blocking-230413/)**, for all intents and purposes under the **control** last **of the State**, with all the other **problems** that derive from it (even accidental).  
Sooner or later an **over-blocking** incident will happen, and there will be **problems with Web services** that have nothing to do with piracy, if they start messing with IPv4 address blocks.

In any case, a **big hit** will probably be seen **on everyone's bill**, even those who do not consume or share pirated material!  
**Centralizing a network** that has existed for decades, built from the beginning as decentralized, is **a tough business**, and other states that work to control information know this well.

An **example** can be given by comparing Russia and China: both states have a certain **desire to control** political dissent on the Internet, but:

* For **Russia it is difficult**, as it has a more **traditional** Internet **infrastructure**, which began to develop as decentralized well **before Putin's arrival**, when the present government was of another type.
* For **China it is easier**, because the government in office **at the time** (the Communist Party, like today), understood the potential of the Internet, and ensured that development took place **immediately ** according to a **centralized** scheme.

It is therefore inevitable that raising this _mega-wall-of-fire_ now, out of nothing_, will entail **substantial costs**, which however will be at the **total expense** of all of us **consumers**, instead of being at expenses of the billion-dollar entertainment multinationals (which will only be burdened by the costs of the unified state platform that will connect rights holders and ISPs).

But this last detail, rightly, does not matter to our parliamentarians and senators, who fortunately for many years have received respectively [1200 and 1650 ‚Ç¨ per year just for telephone costs](https://www.laleggepertutti.it/ 353259_how-much-do-parliamentarians-earn), thanks to those of us, idiot citizens, who pay taxes.

## Hunting for users

In addition to wanting to **counter** in a specific and now unequivocal way the "**live broadcast**" of duplicate content - something that is already generating **discontent** among those football fans with a **tight budget* * - apart from the usual contents in general (audiovisual, press, or IT), the law expressly goes **against end users**, [at least a certain category](https://torrentfreak.com/ew- pirate-iptv-bill-moved-to-senate-as-italy-takes-on-digital-mafias-230324/).

In fact, **fines of up to ‚Ç¨5000** are foreseen in case of repeat offenses, for those who (as far as I can understand, from reading the law and watching other people's videos and articles), purchase subscriptions to paid pirate services, like the famous "**pezzotti**", the illegal _IPTV_ packets.

### Are some okay?

All in all, despite the initial general fear and alarmism, it seems that the only users who have something to fear are precisely the latter, because - although it must be said that I know relatively little about the law, and it is not easy to apply generic understanding skills some text on legal bricks, so who knows - the **text talks about buying or renting**, and **not** even things like **downloading for free**.

If, therefore, up to now, surfing the Internet to **find links** to "crunchy" football matches, with pixels as big as biscuits and the habit of _buffering_, has never actually been prohibited, or **download** the tenth movie of the week via _torrent_, or even **stock up** on repackaged video games for free, one can well imagine that **things will remain as they are** in this sense.

#### ...Maybe not at all

Decidedly **less calm** moments could instead be experienced by those who **participate in sharing** copied content, even with a torrent left in _**seeding**_.  
In Italy it seems that no single _seeder_ has **never been prosecuted**, nor has their connection ever been blocked, but with the authorization to **block** of **IP addresses** the situation risks **changing **, and perhaps from today ISPs will have to **stop trashing** lawyers' letters**; if not the hundreds who arrive every day from the United States, with the presumption of wanting a US-only law to be respected in Europe (the [DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act)), at least those few Italian annuals do (assuming they actually exist!).

## Not only the "digital mafia" will suffer

Those who **are worse off** in this whole story are certainly the members of the "**digital mafia**" - as Massimiliano Capitanio, commissioner of [AGCOM] calls it(https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki /Autorit%C3%A0_per_le_garanzie_nelle_communications) - i.e. those who **sell premium** pirated packages, **profiting**: for them, **fines of up to ‚Ç¨15.5m** and **prison of up to 3 years** .

Perhaps, if this new law targeted **only them**, there wouldn't be much to discuss: they have no passion for sharing, only that of **money* *.  
Perhaps you wouldn't object much even if, by going against the platforms that make certain links available, you considered acting **only against** those **profit-making companies**: Google, Microsoft (with Bing), Facebook, Twitter, and so on.

But in Italy they have already _blown up_ TNTVillage, and I don't want the **decimation** of all the other **online squares** created **by the people for the people** - non-profit, and indeed **often wasteful**, both in time and money - just because **someone is annoyed** by using the **main functionality of the Web**: hyperlinks, invented to encourage **free sharing and free** of culture and entertainment, **without barriers**.
