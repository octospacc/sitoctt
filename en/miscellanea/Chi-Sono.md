Rightly, coming here, whether or not you have read the general information on the site on [Home](./index.html), you will be wondering who I am.

I am Oct. Yes, that's right, Octt from which sitoctt, my site, takes its name.  
_Octt_ is pronounced "Ã²ctt" - [like sitoctt, but without "sit"]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/sitoctt-pronunciation.flac){[:MdTgtBlank:]}.  
I am the webmaster of this place. Or, perhaps, [webmistress](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/webmistress){[:MdTgtBlank:]} would be more correct, too bad that people who even know about the existence of this word count on fingers of a severed hand.

Okay, I understood that there was a need for this site in the world <small>(but when ever??)</small>, I imagined the site, I started building the site, I put in place strategies to simplify my creation of the site <small>(eee, what big words, I wrote a little program in Python)</small>, and here is the result.

## What do I do?

Well, first of all I make this site. I write things, whether they are useless rivers of words in the human language, or little magic words that your computer interprets to display these pages in their most glorious form.

I am the Goddess and loli of [Spacc](https://wikispacc.miraheze.org/wiki/Spacc){[:MdTgtBlank:]}, and CEO of [Spacc Inc](https://wikispacc.miraheze.org/ wiki/Spacc_Inc){[:MdTgtBlank:]}, and sysadmin of the [Spacc BBS](https://bbs.spacc.eu.org). In this regard, destructive responsibilities rest on my shoulders... but I leave the links to follow to understand, I'm not talking about Spacc here.

Then, as much as I try to spend as little time as possible on it, I have my server to administer when things break or something needs to be updated, otherwise who will take care of the whole thing? Between server software for different uses, including web ones, various bots for different platforms, [SpaccCraft](https://wikispacc.miraheze.org/wiki/SpaccCraft){[:MdTgtBlank:]}, and some other stuff that I now I hate to remember, it's beastly stuff, even if at least today I don't have the difficulty of using too much makeshift hardware.

Unfortunately now I often don't find the right time to spend on the Fediverse, as I used to do there before writing and sharing stuff, on the various different nice free platforms.

I often sleep too, ahhh it's nice when you sleep you stay there like that, ohhh, and sometimes it's necessary, oh.

I also write actual programs sometimes. More than anything, little programmers, because if I embark on big undertakings then I risk <small>(no no, it happens often, what "risk", it's a certainty)</small> of leaving stuff abandoned halfway...

Furthermore, think about it: when I have time, I also play video games, or read things like particularly interesting articles (not just the title) or manga. In the past, much more, but today I use my time on many other things, so the game is nice but, now, it always lasts too short.

Here are some video games that I recommend (exhaustive noj list): [Raccolta Videogiochi](./Raccolte/Gaming/Raccolta-Videogiochi.html), while for the other things I haven't assembled lists yet.

Oh, and I also still have to go to school... no, university they tell me now, I think. A bit of a nuisance, okay, there's little you can do.

## Some of my particular properties

â€¢ I am a loli with special properties
: The simple thing is itself a particular property.

â€¢ My favorite color is the background color of the site
: That is, #eeddff. I'm poor and I don't have Pantone colors, this is the maximum precision I can guarantee. I hope your display is calibrated like mine.

â€¢ I like to enslave stones
: I mean, it's not that I enjoy it, it's that I have no other choice, the only way to do the things I like is to enslave computers (which are, at the processor level, thinking rocks).

â€¢ I have little imagination
: In fact, I can't think of any other points to make.

## My contacts

You can find me on the Fediverse, at my favorite contacts that I leave below.

### Cryptography, proofs, and other profiles

I finally decided to set up a cryptographic profile compatible with <b style="Color:#56479E;">Keyoxide</b>, a very nice tool for creating decentralized online identity verifications. Here it is: <https://keyoxide.org/hkp/cfa2a09ce568f17e479d31ad42c0ed2ca5df2af0>{[:MdTgtBlank:]}.

By visiting it, in addition to simply being able to access links to some of my other online profiles, it is possible to have cryptographic proof of the fact that any given account belongs to me, and not to any _sus impostor_.  
It is also possible to take my public PGP key, or use the convenient interface of the app (web or otherwise), to reliably encrypt secret messages to send to me.

# End?

For now, I'm sorry, but that's all. If you want to know more, you'll first have to wait until I think of new stuff to write. Don't hope too much, though, considering that this page hasn't expanded substantially for months and months ðŸ˜¬.

Here on the site, however, I have not yet had clear enough ideas, nor the necessary patience, to create enormous collections on all those elements of knowledge that I possess on very particular subjects. For the moment, at the cost of almost never adding anything, I avoid filling the post with **too much** information; However, I throw them all on [OcttKB](https://kb.octt.eu.org).
