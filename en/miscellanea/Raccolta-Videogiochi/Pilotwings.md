## Pilotwings Resort

Pilotwings Resort continues the Pilotwings arcade flight simulation series in a different way. It ends up on a portable console, the 3DS, among other things a console that manages to grab you directly, with its stereoscopic 3D display. The game is set on Wuhu Island, the same place full of history, locations, and mysteries as Wii Sports Resort. The mission mode can in some cases be a real challenge if, like me, you have a mania for platinum... but the free flight mode is unquestionably relaxing and, perhaps, I would even say more immersive. In it, however, it is not that you do nothing: you have to find, a few at a time, all 120 information rings, passing through them to unlock them.
