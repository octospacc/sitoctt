      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;As the title suggests, this was the poetic thought dispensed by my mother today, after I returned home in the afternoon with a psyche &gt; completely obliterated, unrecognizable.&#xA;Until 30 minutes before, good Maremma, I just wanted to explode. Be careful, though: not for the exam itself (the last in a series of extra-curricular ones, precisely), very simple for me, which I don&#39;t care about except the certification!</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Some will know, in Italy the new anti-piracy law has been approved, and now the doubts with which we enthusiasts of sharing free we have to deal with are different:&#xA;When will it come into force? (I hope not exactly at the time I&#39;m writing this post üò∞) How much money will the entertainment lobbies have spent to ensure that the law was passed with total unanimity?</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Maybe a year ago, partly out of curiosity and partly because I already imagined that it might have been something convenient, I developed a marginal interest in smartphones equipped with complete physical keyboards.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the damn numeric keypads, which you still see on non-smart phones today, I mean keyboards with dozens of individual keys dedicated for letters and symbols.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;A month ago, in the [post of October 18](./2022-09-18- Quando-Metto-Mano-Io-Spacc.html), I briefly said that it was the DSpacc, and what a new mess I had caused.&#xA;Well, this time I did even worse; to understand the proportions, it is good to brush up on what I had written for a second.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;In recent days I have settled the first matters regarding making the site available on the Tor network. There are those who will call me exaggerated for even having the thought of doing something like this, but there is little that can be done.&#xA;If nothing has gone wrong, the Onion service can still be reached at this address: onmfrk2acl4xdeawfjg3nfepq7gcufolctmhiwwxpcknazus5bxzxhqd.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;One thing I did months ago that, so far, has proven to be a winning choice, was install a Linux-based operating system, in persistent mode, * on* a small USB stick.&#xA;The reasons why I wanted to do it initially are perhaps simple and banal, but it gave me, upon careful analysis, some unexpected advantages that were much more than welcome.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;A few months ago I bought a small monocrystalline solar panel online, with dimensions similar to those of an A4 sheet, for the figure of around ‚Ç¨20 (on Amazon.it the sellers are all thieves, on Aliexpress it would have cost a little less).&#xA;![Screenshot of a photo sent in chat.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;For the end of the year, many make a list of good resolutions for the new, while this time I am compiling a collection of some of my shortcomings... welcome back to my world.&#xA;I&#39;m afraid I also have to hurry a bit with this post, because if it came out on the 31st, probably no one would give a damn.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;For almost 7 years I have had an Acer laptop, Aspire V3-572G, undoubtedly now a bit old, without praise and with some infamy.&#xA;When it was purchased, it was essentially a mid-range notebook like any other, without any notable features. I mean, I used it quite a bit and it more or less always did what it was supposed to, until about 2 years ago I started demanding to use heavy games and development tools, at which point the new (desktop) PC was great.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Today&amp;rsquo;s Web is unquestionably very different from that of 20 years ago, and it changes more and more with each passing year.&#xA;Looking at the positive sides of progress is always very easy and reassuring, and for this reason we rarely think about the dark sides which, in many, many things, exist.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;This article can probably be considered as the first of a series on the site philosophy, if you want to say so.&#xA;To start, what is better to talk about, if not everything that led to the birth of the site and began to characterize it?&#xA;When, 3 months ago now, I had just started to conceive the ctt site, one of the things I felt was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a place in which to arrange my stuff - the stuff to be preserved and shared publicly, at least - in a way that made it tidy, available, watchable, usable, and leak-proof.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;For a strange set of reasons, this article sat in my drafts for more than a month, even though it was practically finished.

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Between 1 and 2 months ago - realize how much time passed before I got annoyed definitively - the batteries in the remote control of the television that I keep on my desk (I use it as a second monitor) have started to run out beyond the limitof tolerable usability.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Since I discovered it a few days ago. I&amp;rsquo;m trying that epic software that is TiddlyWiki.&#xA;I initially found it while looking for something to organize notes in a rich format, that I could use for school, and that was obviously free.&#xA;It is a wiki software, practically in the same category as MediaWiki (the software on which Wikipedia is based), but it has very particular characteristics.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;These last 7 days, very little has been said or done here on the ctt site.&#xA;I created this section to use as a general journal, but I&amp;rsquo;m just now writing something.&#xA;First of all, school started again the day before yesterday for me.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s still too early for it to steal my time in the afternoon, but in the morning the story is a bit what it is.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;With summer now at its peak, in yet another extremely hot August, it is practically obligatory that all the traditions of the season are honored, this year too.&#xA;Where do you go on holiday this time too? But at the seaside, of course. In your opinion, who has the most authority in this regard: all those unknown people who every time, almost acting by inertia, punctually choose the mountain again, hoping that in some way this umpteenth time could be the good and fun one.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;This story, more practical than ever, is incredible in my opinion.&#xA;Not only does it demonstrate what lolis can get to with too much free time, like me; shows how everyone among us has a kind of &amp;ldquo;social fingerprint&amp;rdquo; that, if not adequately disguised, can identify us.</description>
