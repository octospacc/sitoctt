      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Since I discovered it a few days ago. I&amp;rsquo;m trying that epic software that is TiddlyWiki.&#xA;I initially found it while looking for something to organize notes in a rich format, that I could use for school, and that was obviously free.&#xA;It is a wiki software, practically in the same category as MediaWiki (the software on which Wikipedia is based), but it has very particular characteristics.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;These last 7 days, very little has been said or done here on the ctt site.&#xA;I created this section to use as a general journal, but I&amp;rsquo;m just now writing something.&#xA;First of all, school started again the day before yesterday for me.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s still too early for it to steal my time in the afternoon, but in the morning the story is a bit what it is.</description>
