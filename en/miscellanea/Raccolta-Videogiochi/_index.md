Why not make a collection to talk, briefly, about the video games I appreciate? <!-- (In alphabetical order) -->  
Perhaps, managing to shine the spotlight on some half-unknown gaming experience which however should deserve much more. And it cannot be excluded that in the future, finding inspiration, I could take and write long and in-depth articles on some of the games that I always praise briefly here, to start with.

For each game, in addition to a short review peppered with some opinions, I will also try to include multimedia material (photos, videos, and music). Finally, when possible, there will be (via an intermission/redirection page) links for physical purchase and download.  
<!--
The external links which are not official but **preceded by a green check** (<span class="twa twa-‚úÖ">‚úÖ</span>) **have** been personally **verified** by me, both as safe that work - the unmarked ones are not verified, but still point to a known reliable source.

<!-- Small note: The subcategories I have here on the page are not fixed. In fact, I could move some games around, following my subsequent analyzes on them. -->

## The epics

This is the place for the best titles, **the epic, one-of-a-kind titles**, period. And here, it absolutely doesn't matter whether a given game is popular or not: it only matters how important it is to me.

## Multi-faceted games

There are certain games that - although technically simple and based on immediate concepts, therefore **implementable** and implemented, at a software level, **infinite times** - can certainly be worthy. Indeed, their simplicity can often be an advantage.  
Basically, here we are talking about classic video games for which there are hundreds of different versions written from scratch. Whenever possible, free implementations are preferred in the ranking.

## Secret pearls

There are some games that maybe don't reach the point of being epic for me, and that's okay - but they are still small pearls, maybe even tiny.  
Why should I talk about it? Because maybe they are really unknown, or almost so; and that is a real, real shame.

...nothing written yet!

## The free ones

Below I would like to collect some unique video games that in my opinion deserve - even if they do not win any place in the epic ranking - but which in addition to being beautiful in themselves have the added value of being **free software**.

If you really want to try something from this page, and you don't really know what, I would say to look right in this section, and do the developers the greatest pleasure if your experience has been worthy: participate in the development, or even just do your turn advertising.

## The rest

I prefer to have this subsection to mention games that, although I liked them enough to end up on this page, are a little less important to me, or a little too well known.  
_Titles that have only one of these two characteristics may also be found in sections above._

~~It may be that I don't have the time, or maybe I don't want to, or maybe it's Antani's fault, but in any case there would be several other works that I haven't yet mentioned here. Perhaps you can find many of them easily on **OcttKB** anyway, under the tag [Gaming](https://kb.octt.eu.org/#Gaming).~~

There are also many other games, retro and modern, which I haven't explored in detail here (or haven't included at all), but they are available (with some encyclopedic information to accompany them) to be **played in the browser** on my site dedicated to gaming , **Sala Museo Games**: <https://gamingshitposting.github.io/SalaMuseoGames>!
