# Videogames Collection

Why not make a collection to talk, briefly, about the video games I appreciate? (In alphabetical order)  
Perhaps, managing to shine the spotlight on some half-unknown gaming experience which however should deserve much more.

It cannot be excluded that in the future, finding inspiration, I could take up and write long and in-depth articles on some of the games that I praise here, unfortunately, in a too "touch and run" way.

For each game, in addition to a short review peppered with some opinions, I will also try to include multimedia material (photos, videos, and music). Finally, when possible, links for physical purchase and download will be present via an intermission/redirection page.  
<!--
The external links which are not official but **preceded by a green check** (<span class="twa twa-‚úÖ">‚úÖ</span>) **have** been personally **verified** by me, both as safe that work - the unmarked ones are not verified, but still point to a known reliable source.

Small note: The subcategories I have here on the page are not fixed. In fact, I could move some games around, following my subsequent analyzes on them.

_Under construction..._

## The epics

This is the place for the best titles, **the epic, one-of-a-kind titles**, period. And here, it absolutely doesn't matter whether a given game is popular or not: it only matters how important it is to me.

### <a href="./2048.html">üî¢Ô∏è 2048 ‚ÜóÔ∏è</a>

### <span class="twa twa-üé©">üé©</span> A Hat in Time  
Lively and frenetic 3D platformer, undoubtedly coming from the Super Mario 64 school. The difficulty of the main story is right, and the game flows pleasantly with an alternation of themes and environments that always feels fresh.  
But, in short, the charisma of the protagonist character alone makes you want to play.

### <span class="twa twa-üçÉ">üçÉ</span> Animal Crossing  
The premises were creative, but boring: you are a human being who, for some reason, goes on a journey to settle in a village where humanoid animals live with whom you can interact. In the meantime, you have to get into debt with a raccoon who sells you the new house at a very high price, and do what you can to repay, with times that can become infinite. Ah, if you want you can choose your clothing, furnish your house, place flowers in the garden... and?  
Animal Crossing is one of those games that simply has to be tried to be understood: staying in that world manages to induce calm and joy for reasons that, apparently, go beyond logic.

### <a href="./Minecraft.html"><span class="twa twa-‚õèÔ∏è">‚õèÔ∏è</span> Minecraft ‚ÜóÔ∏è</a>

### <a href="./Minesweeper.html">üí£ Minesweeper ‚ÜóÔ∏è</a>

### <a href="./Mirrors-Edge.html"><span class="twa twa-üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è">üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span> Mirror's Edge ‚ÜóÔ∏è</a>

<!--
A series of first-person games that, with a lively but not oppressive pace, mixes parkour platforming and close-quarters combat.  
I played the first entry in the saga very little, because it was the second entry, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, that introduced me to the series about 2 years ago. Catalyst leaves aside the highly saturated colors that were part of the initial identity, to offer more realistic and immersive graphics. Physics and several fine details also undergo major improvements compared to the original Mirror's Edge.  
In any case, we are talking about a game capable of giving a great sense of freedom and hope. It's peculiar how its little details manage to make you feel like you're actually in the game - for a non-VR title, that's a big win. The gameplay itself is key to this experience, but the lore is also very respectable.

### <a href="./Nonogram.html">#Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Nonogram ‚ÜóÔ∏è</a>

### <span class="twa twa-üêô">üêô</span> Splatoon  
Third person shooter which to say is different from the others is an understatement. Splatoon breaks the genre's expectations of war realism, and features cute, dazzlingly colorful gameplay that never lets up. There are no humans shooting bullets with iron, but squids spilling ink.  
Playing in Mollusc Melee (this is the name of the 4-on-4 online battles) is fun, but the depth of the game and the inventiveness of the development team can be seen in story mode.

### <a href="#--Tetris"><span class="twa twa-üß±">üß±</span> Tetris ‚Ü©Ô∏è</a>  
#### Tetris Effect  
Tetris effect adds ambient atmospheres to Tetris with many different themes. Visual and sound effects work to enhance each other, and allow for total immersion, even in a game that remains simply made of falling cubes. Hundreds of thousands of particles everywhere, shapes, colors, attractive music, this is its formula. It has some flaws, such as being particularly heavy for a Tetris and having controls that aren't terribly responsive, but that doesn't mean it should be thrown away. It remains to enjoy.

## Multi-faceted games

There are certain games that - although technically simple and based on immediate concepts, therefore **implementable** and implemented, at a software level, **infinite times** - can certainly be worthy. Indeed, their simplicity can often be an advantage.  
Basically, here we are talking about classic video games for which there are hundreds of different versions written from scratch. Whenever possible, free implementations are preferred in the ranking.

### <span class="twa twa-üß±">üß±</span> Tetris  
The game created specifically to make people fit together squares of particular shapes that fall from the sky.  
Puzzle game very particular in its simplicity where, as the game difficulty increases, the lack of quick reflexes can cause the game to end prematurely.

## Secret pearls

There are some games that maybe don't reach the point of being epic for me, and that's okay - but they are still small pearls, maybe even tiny.  
Why should I talk about it? Because maybe they are really unknown, or almost so; and that is a real, real shame.

...nothing written yet!

## The free ones

Below I would like to collect some unique video games that in my opinion deserve - even if they don't win any place in the epic ranking - but which in addition to being beautiful in themselves have the added value of being **free software**.

If you really want to try something from this page, and you don't really know what, I would say to look right in this section, and do the developers the greatest pleasure if your experience has been worthy: participate in the development, or even just do your turn advertising.

### <span class="twa twa-üèéÔ∏è">üèéÔ∏è</span> SuperTuxKart  
A kart racing game with cute and original environments, and many mascots from the world of free software as characters. It has different game modes, from classic racing to missions with specific objectives, solo or multiplayer. In some ways it has more than Mario Kart!

## The rest

I prefer to have this subsection to mention games that, although I liked them enough to end up on this page, are a little less important to me, or a little too well known.  
_Titles that have only one of these two characteristics may also be found in sections above._

### <span class="twa twa-üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è">üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span> Light blue  
Celeste is a nice little platformer game, with original mechanics and a unique graphic style. But it's too difficult.  
I tried to play it many times, but at a certain point in the story the difficulty became too high for me. I should maybe try finishing it in guided mode, since the option is there. Until I've done it, though, I'm not going to look for videos of the ending and spoil stuff, since they say that the value of Celeste lies precisely in its meaning.

### <span class="twa twa-‚úàÔ∏è">‚úàÔ∏è</span> Pilotwings
#### Pilotwings Resort  
Pilotwings Resort continues the Pilotwings arcade flight simulation series in a different way. It ends up on a portable console, the 3DS, among other things a console that manages to grab you directly, with its stereoscopic 3D display. The game is set on Wuhu Island, the same place full of history, locations, and mysteries as Wii Sports Resort. The mission mode can in some cases be a real challenge if, like me, you have a mania for platinum... but the free flight mode is unquestionably relaxing and, perhaps, I would even say more immersive. In it, however, it is not that you do nothing: you have to find, a few at a time, all 120 information rings, passing through them to unlock them.

## Still others

It may be that I don't have the time, or maybe I don't want to, or maybe it's Antani's fault, but in any case there would be several other works that I haven't mentioned here. Perhaps you can easily find many of them on **OcttKB** anyway, under the tag [Gaming](https://kb.octt.eu.org/#Gaming).
