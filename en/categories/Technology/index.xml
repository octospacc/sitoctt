      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Maybe a year ago, partly out of curiosity and partly because I already imagined that it might have been something convenient, I developed a marginal interest in smartphones equipped with complete physical keyboards.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the damn numeric keypads, which you still see on non-smart phones today, I mean keyboards with dozens of individual keys dedicated for letters and symbols.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;One thing I did months ago that, so far, has proven to be a winning choice, was install a Linux-based operating system, in persistent mode, * on* a small USB stick.&#xA;The reasons why I wanted to do it initially are perhaps simple and banal, but it gave me, upon careful analysis, some unexpected advantages that were much more than welcome.</description>
