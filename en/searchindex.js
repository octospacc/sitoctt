Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\n2️⃣ Synchronized gaming between PlayStation 2 and smartphone Those who have been following my adventures for long enough and with due attention perhaps know this, but the biggest problem in computer science is: how to properly reconcile the discrepancies that are created when we face the problem of playing video games both at home than in portability? Between games that in one case are comfortable to play and in another perhaps don't even run, and the saves that are spread across countless different devices, solving this problem completely will never be possible...\nYet, sometimes, the entropy of the brain is able to generate particularly useful ideas in this regard too, as happened to me the other day for the PS2.\nIn fact, I have a real PlayStation 2, a home console that when you find a way to use it is certainly appreciable... and that I often found myself not using, for the reasons mentioned above: not directly, because at home I often don't goes, nor with an emulator on the smartphone, because I would feel that at home I wouldn't use the real console since the updated saves would only be on the phone.\nAnd then, just the other day, staring at the console (I'm not sure why), I thought there should be a way to have the saves easily synchronized between it and the phone...\nSnag 1: USB stick or memory card? At the time, the simplest idea I thought of was: they exist adapters to use a microSD card as a PlayStation memory card (which use a non-standard interface instead)... it might be worth buying one of those, so I keep them all there the saves, and if desired I can also access them from other devices by moving the card around.1 With a card of several GB (there aren't any small ones around anymore anyway), furthermore, I could even do without the USB stick and keep all the games only on the memory card!\nFortunately, this is not the only way, at least for certain games: Open PS2 Loader, the homebrew that runs commercial games from backup storage (such as USB sticks), supports the use of virtual memory cards (VMCs) that are saved as files on the USB drive. Games are quite slow to save on that (the PS2 only supports USB 1.1, plus there's some strange overhead), but it's an apparently workable solution.\nHitch 2: Save conversion Regardless of the previous choice, however, I discover another obstacle: the saves should be converted to be passed from the console to the emulator (at least AetherSX2, for better or worse the only truly decent one to date) and then vice versa.\nFortunately, I immediately find mymc, a program so old that it requires Python 2 (while at the moment we've been on 3 for years and years), which however works, and thank goodness it offers a command line interface.\nIt doesn't do true virtual memory card conversions per se, but it allows you to manipulate the contained files in various ways. All very crude, but fortunately exploitable enough to do just what I need, after having assembled an ideal script.\nI won't try to explain how it works, at the bottom of the article you can download it and read it, it's boring. I packaged mymc inside the script, so that it doesn't have to be installed separately.\nSnag 3: Converting from your phone Note 2023-10-18: I found a modern fork (in Python 3) of mymc, mymc+... I haven't tried it (yet), but it's possible that this could work on Android too, eliminating the fiddly setup that follows, so I'll mention it. Unfortunately, mymc has some problems running in Termux (the native Linux environment very convenient for this type of integrations) on my Android: I don't know what's to blame, but in practice the program has problems reading VMC files, throwing an error like file.vmc : Bad file descriptor. I couldn't find any solutions online, not even for general searches of the problem, so I had to make do. Maybe using a containerized GNU+Linux system in root, with its libraries and a different build of Python 2.7, would be enough to solve the problem, but who knows.\nFor my part, I was starting to get annoyed, and so I opted to delegate the conversion to my Debian server, having a Termux script carry out the simple task of loading the VMC on the server, running the actual conversion script there, and then download the converted file to the right location locally.\nBefore I forget: on Android 13 and higher (but already from some past versions) root permissions are needed to read and write files from/to external memories (such as the USB stick) and private application folders (such as the one where AetherSX2 stores the virtual memory cards).\nFrom what I have been able to prove, if you don't have root you will necessarily have to use a suitable file manager (and I don't think there are scriptable ones, so you have to use your hands), or perhaps ADB, to move the files around... thank Google.\nIn any case, my scripts have written in the special paths used for all the ambaradan.\nUsing Termux:Widget, I finally added two links to my system launcher, for VMC conversion:\none that goes from the PS2 format to the emulator one, to be run when I want to play on my phone but the saves on the pen drive were last modified by the PS2; the other for the reverse conversion, to be performed when I want to go and play on the PS2 once the emulator has updated my saves. To explain it I realize that it seems very complicated, in practice I just have to press a button and wait a few seconds.\nIn practice: the value of unique memory Once the kinks have been eliminated, the configuration is done, and its strong point lies in the centralization of games and saves on a single device: the USB key. Like this:\nI avoid the confusion generated by games that I have on one side but not the other, especially when I want to modify my collection; I don't need a much larger microSD in my smartphone to contain all the games I already have on another portable memory, with advantages for the stability of the other data and the weight of the wallet; there is no extra confusion for the management of even the saves, these being managed as I said before. On the PS2 I normally connect the pen drive when I need it, however on the smartphone I have to use a USB-C OTG adapter, which is on average inconvenient but there is little that can be done. To avoid losing these things around, I then attached a carabiner to the USB stick, and a key ring in the hole for the lanyards on the phone cover.\nConcluding: chain ideas I believe that this is the most ideal system given my initial conditions, and in the following days I will test it thoroughly.\nHowever, I will probably have to get a larger external memory to store more games, because the 32 GB one I use now has always been too small for me.\nMaybe, by taking a large enough one, and writing a special homebrew, I think I can adapt this system of mine for Wii games too, using the same memory for those too... spoilers? 👀\nFinally, here are the additional resources for this article:\nMy initial question and brief system discussion on Sony Hacking Zone: https:/ /t.me/SonyHacking/46784; Guide to using VMC on OPL: https://youtube.com /watch?v=tBrKcJC_E4U My conversion scripts (on GitLab): direct, via server\u003c /a\u003e; AetherSX2 Android build I play (latest without adware): https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/aethersx2/aethersx2/aethersx2-v1-4-3060-release/ aethersx2-v1-4-3060-android-apk-download/. On this issue I find conflicting opinions or not very clear advice, so be careful: it is not clear whether these adapters also work as normal memory cards for saving games (and therefore also possibly as an FMCB card), or only as external memory for homebrews like OPL... in any case it would be a potentially valid purchase, considering the technical drawbacks of USB on PS2. ↩\n","date":"October 18, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/note/2023-10-18-2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-Gaming-synchronized-between-PlayStation-2-and-smartphone/","section":"Notes","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Or, perhaps, webmistress would be more correct, too bad that the number of people who even know about the existence of this word can be counted on the fingers of one severed hand.\nOkay, I understood that there was a need for this site in the world (but when ever??), I imagined the site, I started building the site, I put in place strategies to simplify my creation of the site (eee, what big words, I wrote a little program in Python), and here is the result.\nWhat do I do? Well, first of all I make this site. I write things, whether they are useless rivers of words in the human language, or little magic words that your computer interprets to display these pages in their most glorious form.\nI am the Goddess and loli of Spacc, as well as CEO of Spacc Inc, and sysadmin of Spacc BBS. In this regard, destructive responsibilities rest on my shoulders\u0026hellip; but I leave the links to follow to understand, I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about Spacc here.\nThen, as much as I try to spend as little time as possible on it, I have my server to administer when things break or something needs to be updated, otherwise who will take care of the whole thing? Between server software for different uses, including web ones, various bots for different platforms, SpaccCraft, and some other stuff that I\u0026rsquo;m now bored of remembering, it\u0026rsquo;s a beastly, even if at least today I don\u0026rsquo;t have the difficulty of using too much makeshift hardware.\nUnfortunately now I often don\u0026rsquo;t find the right time to spend on the Fediverse, as I used to do there before writing and sharing stuff, on the various different nice free platforms.\nI often sleep too, ahhh it\u0026rsquo;s nice when you sleep you stay there like that, ohhh, and sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s necessary, oh.\nI also write actual programs sometimes. More than anything, little programmers, because if I embark on big undertakings then I risk (no no, it happens often, what \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s a certainty) of leaving stuff abandoned halfway\u0026hellip;\nFurthermore, think about it: when I have time, I also play video games, or read things like particularly interesting articles (not just the title) or manga. In the past, much more, but today I use my time on many other things, so the game is nice but, now, it always lasts too short.\nHere are some video games that I recommend (exhaustive noj list): Raccolta Videogiochi, while for the other things I haven\u0026rsquo;t assembled lists yet.\nOh, and I also still have to go to school\u0026hellip; no, university they tell me now, I think. A bit of a nuisance, okay, there\u0026rsquo;s little you can do.\nSome of my particular properties • I am a loli with special properties The simple thing is itself a particular property. • My favorite color is the background color of the site That is, #eeddff. I\u0026rsquo;m poor and I don\u0026rsquo;t have Pantone colors, this is the maximum precision I can guarantee. I hope your display is calibrated like mine. • I like to enslave stones I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s not that I enjoy it, it\u0026rsquo;s that I have no other choice, the only way to do the things I like is to enslave computers (which are, at the processor level, thinking rocks). • I have little imagination In fact, I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any other points to make. My contacts You can find me on the Fediverse, at my favorite contacts that I leave below.\nFriendica: @octt@poliverso.org Mastodon: @octo@mastodon.uno Matrix: @octt:matrix.org There were also my ActivityPub instances here, but then [incidents] happened(../Posts/2023-01-28-Problemi-Hardware-Diventano-Mentali). Cryptography, proofs, and other profiles I finally decided to set up a cryptographic profile compatible with Keyoxide, a very nice tool for creating decentralized online identity verifications. Here it is: https://keyoxide.org/hkp/cfa2a09ce568f17e479d31ad42c0ed2ca5df2af0.\nBy visiting it, in addition to simply being able to access links to some of my other online profiles, it is possible to have cryptographic proof of the fact that any given account belongs to me, and not to any sus impostor.\nIt is also possible to take my public PGP key, or use the convenient interface of the app (web or otherwise), to reliably encrypt secret messages to send to me.\nEnd? For now, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but that\u0026rsquo;s all. If you want to know more, you\u0026rsquo;ll first have to wait until I think of new stuff to write. Don\u0026rsquo;t hope too much, though, considering that this page hasn\u0026rsquo;t expanded substantially for months and months 😬.\nHere on the site, however, I have not yet had clear enough ideas, nor the necessary patience, to create enormous collections on all those elements of knowledge that I possess on very particular subjects.

Be careful, though: not for the exam itself (the last in a series of extra-curricular ones, precisely), very simple for me, which I don't care about except the certification!\u003c a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn1\"\u003e1 Something else happened.\nLet's go back When I went through the first sessions two years ago, everything went very smoothly, almost in the name of chilling: those were still the times of anti-COVID restrictions, and those 2 exams that I faced at school they were in a classroom which was however not very crowded.\nThis year, however, crap. I took the card without repeating anything, so my parents didn't waste money on that matter, but the experience was terrifying.\nThe class at these rounds was always packed, and this very thing ended up being a problem for my soul.\nI don't think I deserve all this...\nThere are problems in the air Last month I took 2 tests out of the 3 I was missing, and already nothing went smoothly at all:\nMy professor (project contact) hadn't told me that I should have received a private link in the email address of the school domain to create an account on the online exam platform... Too bad that access I only have it at the post office on Puppy Linux thumb drive and on the tablet, and I can't access anywhere else2. Result: I had to rush home to get the tablet and go back to school... Luckily I live nearby.\nThe testing platform totally broke when I finished one of the exams (not without difficulty, some questions were [glitchate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch#Computerglitch)_ !): as soon as I started the second one, the system said that I had run out of time, and closed the test I had just started in my face... The prof. he had to waste time calling support to explain the matter, and after quite a mess the exam was reset as not taken.\nBetween both things, then, a good amount of time was lost. And if it hadn't been like this, maybe I would have managed to finish all the exams that day.\nThe present Let's go back to today.\nOnce the hassle of waiting was over (not too problematic, thanks to the rectangle of plastic, glass, metal, with Internet connection, and pocket book, which I also always carry around), due to the fact that all the stations were occupied initially, start.\n...But I had never done it!\nMy first few minutes go fine, until even a good selection (random, or did destiny choose them carefully?) of monkeys, who from the rows behind everything were babbling with those who (I imagine in confidence) had not yet finished, at an exaggerated volume and in contemporary.\nHere, now, slowly, the blood begins to boil in my body, as if it were a coffee pot, because with that mess I can't read \u003e half of a question without getting totally distracted. Even having earphones in my ears (but detached) didn't attenuate the noise enough. Finish the exam like that? Impossible.\nI tried Before it was too late, I tried to call the teacher — who, damn the extreme, was quite distracted , because another person at that moment had the same glitch as my previous time (and here I have to: what a shitty backend this platform has, throw it away and rewrite it from scratch, please!! !).\nI wanted to kindly tell him to keep all those who had no right to speak in silence, and after a few minutes (to his credit, of his own accord, a moment before he heard me ) blathered something (unconvincing) to tell the audience to calm down. The audience did not calm down, and the prof. he was going crazy due to the general problems, unfortunately, so he couldn't listen to me much.\nThe last time there was less mess. Perhaps because there were fewer wrong individuals, perhaps because I was at the PC in the far corner of the room (which today was not turned on), perhaps because, given that there was an external commissioner, the rules could only be violated without making any noise. I don't know.\nI even decide to call my father on the phone, upon arriving here, to tell him to call the professor on the phone; maybe this time around he can understand. In fact, this time the call for silence was more convincing. Was it?\nA disaster But, by now, too late anyway: my tension has risen too much, I can't regain a minimum of concentration, forcing myself, after perhaps a good 21 months in which I was able to do without it, scratching myself to convert a minimal part of the mental load (which requires major mental energies to be managed, the same ones that I needed at that moment to complete my session) into skin burning (which, to a certain level, is managed by the brain in the background). What a drag.\nI've already done the damage, alas and what the fuck, and it seemed that everything was slowly calming down and concentration could return... but instead No. The call of the prof. However, it was too soft and did not stop the bad behavior of that part of the other students, it just put them on hold a bit.\nThe real solution Well, at this point I simply feel like throwing a fist on the desk and \"screaming\" (not that I know how to do it, but the fist just makes up for the this is useful; I unconsciously learned from another professor of mine) to be silent, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to accomplish anything, and... it worked\u003c /strong\u003e. Oh?...\nYes, that's all. I can't say anything else about this moment, it immediately crystallized into goodness. From there, until I finished and was able to leave, not a fly flew again.\nAt that point, unfortunately, I had accumulated the irritation anyway, and it took me hours and hours and hours \u003e to dispose of it, between doing various random things and writing this article.\nThe only thing I can logically regret is not having made that bench resonate a few precious minutes before seriously reaching the limit, given that gentle methods didn't work. Unfortunately or fortunately, damn, it's not a reflection that arises in me too often; only when I am already over that limit, and perhaps I have already committed other avoidable damage.\nAnd yet, that doubt still remains: but what have I done that was so bad in the world to deserve these things? And let's understand...\n🏷️ Notes and References The certification... oh God, even the latter, not that I care personally: on my deathbed I don't strong\u003e I will certainly be counting the cards that I could have but didn't want to get; mainly my parents convinced me, so whatever.

(I hope not exactly at the time I'm writing this post 😰) How much money will the entertainment lobbies have spent to ensure that the law was passed with total unanimity? What real consequences will it bring to us ordinary citizens? Blocks (instant and per IP) The point that perhaps struck me most about the law (here the PDF examined by the Commission, and the final report) - perhaps because I own various online properties, totally personal, which have zero economic value for me, but unquantifiable sentimental value - it is the obligation for Internet service providers to respond to blocking requests snapshots.\nA copyright holder can send a blackout request which, when it is urgent - think of a meeting live sports, which is being illegally retransmitted in real time - must be honored in no more than 30 minutes by all providers, without any adversarial or formal process: it will be \u003ethe owner of the blocked website will then have to open legal proceedings to challenge the blocking and request its restoration.\nFor illicit sites, all domain and subdomain names (DNS), and IP addresses, present will be blocked and, I have no idea under what limits , all possible futures.\nThe new responsibilities By \"suppliers\" we do not mean only the telephone operators who provide the connection to the Internet, but in general those \"involved in any capacity in the accessibility\" of illegal services, and it is even explicit reference to search engines.\nSearch engines do nothing but return links accompanied by a description, and in reality they do not directly provide pirate material: in practice , this law even aims to hinder those who only provide links, not just those who physically allow the downloading of data.\nFor this logic, the managers of social networks will also be held responsible (and I imagine that with \"information society\" in text refers specifically to them), and possibly small online communities.\nAn expensive firewall The potential for abuse and errors is very high, and in fact, seen impartially, this move can in any case be summarized in the obligation for ISPs to build a mega-firewall, to all intents and purposes under the ultimate control of the State, with all the others \u003eproblems that arise from it (even accidental).\nSooner or later an over-blocking incident will happen, and there will be problems with Web services that have nothing to do with piracy, if they start messing around with address blocks IPv4.\nIn any case, a big hit will probably be seen on everyone's bill, even those who do not consume or share pirated material!\nCentralizing a network that has existed for decades, built from the beginning as decentralized, is a tough business, and other states that work to control information know this well .\nAn example can be given by comparing Russia and China: both states have a certain desire to control political dissent on the Internet, but: For Russia it is difficult, as it has a more traditional Internet infrastructure, which began to develop as decentralized well \u003c strong\u003ebefore Putin's arrival, when the present government was of another type. For China it is easier, because the government in office at the time (the Communist Party, like today), understood the potential of the Internet, and made sure that development took place immediately according to a centralized scheme. It is therefore inevitable that raising this mega-wall-of-fire now, out of nothing, will entail substantial costs, which however will be at the total expense\u003c /strong\u003e of all of us consumers, instead of being at the expense of billion-dollar entertainment multinationals (which will only be burdened by the costs of the unified state platform that will connect rights holders and ISPs). But this last detail, rightly, does not matter to our parliamentarians and senators, who fortunately for many years have received respectively 1200 and 1650 € per year just for telephone costs, thanks to those of us, idiot citizens, who pay taxes.\nHunting for users In addition to wanting to counter in a specific and now unequivocal way the \"live broadcast\" of duplicate content - something that is already generating discontent among those football fans with a tight budget - apart from the usual content in general (audiovisual, print, or IT), the law expressly goes against end users , at least a certain category.\nIn fact, fines of up to €5000 are foreseen in the event of a repeat offense, for those who (as far as I can understand, from reading the law and watching other people's videos and articles) purchase subscriptions to paid pirate services, such as the famous \"pezzotti\", the illegal IPTV packages.\nAre some okay? All in all, despite the initial general fear and alarmism, it seems that the only users who have something to fear are precisely the latter, because - although it must be said that I know relatively little about the law, and it is not easy to apply generic text comprehension skills on legal bricks, so who knows - the text talks about purchasing or renting, and not also things like downloading at no cost \u003e.\nIf, therefore, up to now, surfing the Internet to find links to \"crisp\" football matches, with pixels has never actually been prohibited as big as biscuits and the habit of buffering, or download the tenth film of the week via torrent, or even stocking up \u003e of free video games repackaged, one can well imagine that things will remain as they are in this sense.\n...Maybe not absolutely Definitely less peaceful moments could be experienced by those who participate in the sharing of copied content, even with a torrent left in seeding \u003e.\nIn Italy it seems that no single seeder has ever been prosecuted, nor has his connection ever been blocked, but with the authorization to block IP addresses the situation risks changing, and perhaps from today ISPs will have to stop throwing away lawyers' letters ; if not the hundreds who arrive every day from the United States, with the presumption of wanting a US-only law to be respected in Europe (the DMCA), at least those few Italian annuals do (assuming they really exist!).\nIt's not just the \"digital mafia\" that will suffer Those who are worse off in this whole story are certainly the members of the \"digital mafia\" - as Massimiliano Capitanio, commissioner of AGCOM - that is, those who sell premium pirated packages , profiting: for them, fines of up to €15.5m and prison of up to 3 years.\nPerhaps, if this new law targeted only them, there wouldn't be much to discuss: they have no passion for sharing, only that of money.\nPerhaps there would not be much of an objection even if, by going against the platforms that make certain links available, we considered acting only against those profit-making companies: Google, Microsoft ( with Bing), Facebook, Twitter, and so on.\nBut in Italy they have already blown up TNTVillage, and I don't want the decimation of all the other online marketplaces created \u003c strong\u003eby the people for the people - non-profit, and indeed often disposable, both in time and money - just because it bothers someone that the main functionality of the Web is used: hyperlinks, invented to encourage the free and free sharing of culture and entertainment, without barriers.

And in the end? Well, it will never come to an end\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;WIP. For other information that is not totally subjective, for now there is Wikipedia.\nMy story I discovered Minecraft when I was maybe 7 years old, because another kid had it on his tablet at after school. I remember that he had built several large buildings, with decorations and everything. I was blown away practically instantly, because I had never seen any game that was remotely close to this one, even though at the time we were in the very first alpha versions of Minecraft Pocket Edition, which had very little content (less than Minecraft Java alpha!).\nIt was difficult to get the application, for reasons relating to my general use of Android at the time, but I finally managed to get it on my Galaxy Player, and then on my break-in tablet. At first I had the demo, needless to say it wasn\u0026rsquo;t good because progress couldn\u0026rsquo;t be saved upon exit, and so playing was pointless. Then, somehow that I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember, I managed to find the APK of the full version.\nFrom there, every hour of play was a new discovery, or a new self-imposed goal accomplished. I started building strange buildings that were difficult to navigate, with intricate passages, that if I wanted to do today I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even know where to start. Due to a whole series of events, I lost the worlds I had on the tablet (which were nothing special, in fact I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember them well), but those of the Galaxy Player are still there today. Here are some photos of what was my major at the time: https://pixelfed.uno/p/octo/299639948389257216.\nShortly afterwards I learned, thanks to an application that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember whether I discovered it by chance on Google Play or was recommended to me, of the existence of thematic maps created and shared by other players online. I lost some time on them, especially on the parkour ones: with the touch controls (and at the time no crouching!) they quickly became torture, but when you manage to make the difficult jumps and move forward it\u0026rsquo;s always nice.\nOn the PC I had at home at the time, there was no way to start Minecraft, for who knows what obscure reason; I imagine ancient video card and/or video drivers. At the end of 2014 I then tried to run it on what was at this point my new Windows tablet (still broken, but in different ways than the Android one), and somehow it started, but it ran too slow to be playable. Too bad I didn\u0026rsquo;t know at the time that I could try lowering the resolution or running an older version to get more performance. When 2 months later, now in 2015, the new PC arrived at home, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember why but I didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to run Minecraft. Sadness. At the end of the new year I then got the laptop, and I put Minecraft there, and I wore it out, sure enough I wore it out!\nI started there both playing offline and on some Italian servers. A few months later, when I bought a legitimate account of the game, I was also able to try globally renowned servers such as Hypixel, and others that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember now, because today they are totally irrelevant or possibly even dead!\nIt was on PC that I started seeing big things with redstone, because MCPE at the time was still in alpha and relatively barebones: a lot of elements were missing. Who knows where the hell I saved my first superflat world made there, with all the useless constructions and experiments! I should look it up.\nOnline, I immediately started testing minigames on servers: SkyWars, BedWars, Hunger Games, PvP FFA, a few minor non-violent ones. On BedWars at a certain point I end up spending so many hours in a row over the months that my performances actually become good and I often win the games, but if I tried to play it again now (and I tried again), I would realize how much rust I have accumulated.\nI then also gave a chance to multiplayer game options structured in the long term, and not as minigames in games: creative battles, classic survival, but above all SkyBlock, that was epic stuff.\nThen there were other things in between, between MCPE becoming Bedrock Edition, better in some things and (still) worse in others, time spent on Minecraft Console Edition (the old version before Bedrock supplanted it) with its minigames integrated which were really nice. When I got a new Nintendo 3DS XL in the summer of 2019, I started playing Minecraft on that too, which was more convenient for me than playing with touch controls on a smartphone (for when I\u0026rsquo;m on the move), and it continues to this day.\nNow there are alternating months in which I open Minecraft almost every day, and others (definitely more frequent) in which I completely forget that it exists. Almost 3 years ago SpaccCraft was born - the third edition, if we want to be honest towards those other two worlds in which we exaggerated a little too much and did literally smash, but basically we have to since \u0026ldquo;SpaccCraft\u0026rdquo; it comes right from there - and now that too has declined. The server works, but it runs practically empty, no one plays and I can\u0026rsquo;t complain too much about it, as first of all I don\u0026rsquo;t find the time to do it.\nTake a look at the SpaccCraft website, there\u0026rsquo;s a bit more concrete stuff to see, and a few ruminations about my whole life.\n","date":"April 1, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/miscellanea/raccolta-videogiochi/%EF%B8%8F-Minecraft/","section":"Miscellany","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Literally standing on the edge of the mirror, the edges of the enormous glass of which the buildings of La Città are made, one runs and jumps without any brakes.\nThe parkour element of the game is extremely immersive; although I haven\u0026rsquo;t played the first game in the series for long enough, but only the second, Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge: Catalyst, I can talk about a magical experience about the latter. Perhaps thanks to the graphics, more realistic than the first game, certainly thanks to the controls, responsive but not excessively taxing, the pace of the game is naturally pressing.\nFor a title that can be enjoyed with standard equipment, not in virtual reality, the extent of this quality is decidedly impressive. Often while playing Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge I found myself in states of flow that were both refreshing and tense in which, without me thinking too much about it, I went in just a few seconds from anxiety due to exaggerated leaps of faith, in which it was as if my weight on the chair was canceled out making me feel like I was suspended in the air, to others of continuous running with low effort, almost as if Faith was moving alone and not by my hand.\nThe game cannot disappoint even those who, after a subjective analysis, might believe that such a formula could quickly become monotonous: Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge is not just platforming and parkour, but features hand-to-hand combat against human entities (practically the police who want to hinder runners). In the most suitable moments to break up the rhythm of the gameplay, you come across stakeouts that you have to deal with immediately, with dry and continuous moves: the less time you waste, and the sooner you continue on your path, the better.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a real shame that, with a very good probability, we will never see a third game be created for the saga, for reasons related to the trends of the video game market. Oh God, actually a third game already exists, Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge Mobile: it was released in 2011 (well before Catalyst) for iOS and Windows Phone, and perhaps I could try it with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Windows Phone emulator for Windows desktop, I would like to be able to play it on my Android smartphone, but for the moment this is not yet possible.\n","date":"April 1, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/miscellanea/raccolta-videogiochi/%EF%B8%8F-Mirrors-Edge/","section":"Miscellany","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

So, aren\u0026rsquo;t you having just one more play?\nHowever, if you have lost the game, the need to immediately start a new one is compelling and difficult to ignore. If at this point you end the game, despite your desire, then there will be plenty of room for those thoughts that say how you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to play Minesweeper, and your time will never get shorter!\nThis is all absurd if you consider what stuff we\u0026rsquo;re talking about:\nAn overall bland puzzle, with essential controls, sparse graphics (even the slightly more elaborate implementations have a practical limit to the graphical improvements they can make), and simple logic.\nA program that was born 3 decades ago, together with Windows Solitaire, simply to teach people to use the mouse in a fun way.\nA game belonging to a distant era in which the concept of \u0026ldquo;gamification\u0026rdquo; was alien to everyone, and free-to-play video games were truly free: not built specifically to create addiction or pressure on players, as in-app purchases didn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nPersonally, I also call the minefield \u0026ldquo;minesweeper\u0026rdquo;, to joke about an incorrect pseudo-literal translation of the word \u0026ldquo;minesweeper\u0026rdquo; (literally but correctly \u0026ldquo;minesweeper \u0026ldquo;) in Italian. At certain moments, in an instant it becomes \u0026ldquo;minaspiazzante\u0026rdquo;, when it puts you in front of strange crossroads or intricate bomb placement schemes.\nBut, if these are all things that even a third party observer can notice, this apparently simple and office pastime hides much more. Minesweeper somehow manages to offer emotions that, again due to the objective circumstances, are difficult to communicate to the world.\nOnce you get the hang of it, after hundreds of games played and repeated over time, the moment of playing often becomes comparable to a meditative session capable of absorbing your soul. Only those who have made this puzzle their daily bread know the sensation: the hand is moved according to an overflowing flow of commands, imparted directly from an instinctive layer of the mind, often at a speed greater than that in which the conscious brain can register what the hell is happening; sometimes, after making the right moves in the heat of the situation (but never made at random), these are questioned by the conscious part of the mind about a fraction of a second later! - for no reason, because, again, correct.\nBy accumulating that single or double daily batch over the weeks, months, and years, you unconsciously learn to recognize all the mine placement patterns: the images of the numbered tiles - arranged exactly in a certain way, or another, of the dozens of possible - are imprinted in the mind and are then automatically fished out and analyzed the moment you are about to click. Hence some people claim to experience something similar to the \u0026ldquo;Tetris effect\u0026rdquo; with Minesweeper too: seeing patterns of numbered tiles in random semi-conscious situations (e.g., half-asleep).\nParaphrasing what [a PCGamesN author] writes (https://www.pcgamesn.com/minesweeper/get-free): Minesweeper is one of the purest forms of digital escapism that you can experience, because it is the practical demonstration of how a game, to be deeply immersive, does not have a vital need for a detailed open world, elaborate narrative, or characters to become attached to.\n...Sorry, there's work in progress on this page, I'm setting mines around to troll the next people who come here to read and they will stumble upon a few words... if in the meantime you want to learn how to play read [Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/Campo_minato_(videogioco)), go ahead...\nCuriosity In the 90s, even at Microsoft everyone was [obsessed with Minesweeper, especially Bill Gates](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped -lead-to-the-xbox). I would say that it is not difficult to see how\u0026hellip;\nIn 1999, following complaints from a certain Sergio Chiodo (??), who argued that the concept of the minefield game was offensive to the victims of real anti-personnel mines in the world, the International Campaign for the banning of Campo Minato. Microsoft partially buckled under the pressure, and in Windows Me and 2000 replaced the bombs in the game with flowers, and renamed the game \u0026ldquo;Meadow of Flowers\u0026rdquo;.1\nThe campaign only caught on to a limited extent outside Italy (?), and only with Windows Vista did the concept of the meadow of flowers game become global. Microsoft has given the possibility to change the game included in the system between mine theme and flower theme, a setting which has a different default value based on the country.2 Implementations For PC, the Microsoft original isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad. The Windows XP version works on the latest versions of the system, and even on Wine. Unfortunately, it scales a little poorly on high-resolution screens, as the squares are a fixed size and there is no zoom. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t been included in Windows for years, perhaps for this reason, but it can be downloaded from the Web:\nGlobal XP Version: Minesweeper.exe Italian XP version: Prato Fiorito.exe On Android, and I dare say in general, the best implementation I\u0026rsquo;ve found is Antimine.\nDownload from F-Droid: dev.lucanlm.antimine Source Code: antimine-android To play from Web browser, well, on this page I\u0026rsquo;m putting together something that for my personal tastes is the best available. It works well on both desktop and mobile (although the time you have to hold down a dial to plant a flag is long there), and has minimal graphics.\nI\u0026rsquo;m working on making the game customizable, for the moment you can only play with what I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented as a minigame to unlock reading the Curiosities section (if you don\u0026rsquo;t see anything, activate JavaScript!).\nNote: My implementation is based on vue-minesweeper, with some personal modifications for embedding. All my modified code is in the sitoctt repository (MIT license).\nSimilar and Clones Bullets, Minefield playable on paper.\nKaboom, a \u0026ldquo;cruel but honest\u0026rdquo; Minesweeper:\nThe placement of mines is not chosen once and for all at the beginning, but with each move. When you are in a situation of guessing (there are no adjacent cells proven to be safe), you have a 100% chance of surviving. When you don\u0026rsquo;t have to guess, and you do, the game chooses the worst possible outcome. The game with these rules develops in a new and interesting way, as you often find yourself in a situation where you have to think in a really tough way (at least, until you manage to unconsciously learn all the possible patterns: after months and months of usual matches).\nOther Resources Authoritative Minesweeper\nMinesweeper is one of the purest gaming experiences\n🏷️ Notes and References https://tcrf.net/Minesweeper_(Windows,_1990)/en#Regional_Differences\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper#Windows_Vista_and_Windows_7\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"March 28, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/miscellanea/raccolta-videogiochi/Minesweeper/","section":"Miscellany","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nMaybe a year ago, partly out of curiosity and partly because I already imagined that it might have been something convenient, I developed a marginal interest in smartphones equipped with complete physical keyboards.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t mean the damn numeric keypads, which you still see on non-smart phones today, I mean keyboards with dozens of individual keys dedicated for letters and symbols.\nThis type of keyboard was already rare to see on phones prior to the smartphone era: it first appeared not on ultra-cheap models, but in any case it might not always be very comfortable due to its small size.\nThe more smartphones began to spread, the more physical keyboards began to disappear, even if they rarely existed on some modern phones, and even of generous dimensions.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember if this time last year was just before or shortly after I bought a new smartphone, my current one today; the fact is that I had to choose it based on precise and restrictive criteria, first and foremost the cost and, unfortunately, there was no low range with a physical keyboard.\nA new idea As time passed I forgot about the issue a bit, until, a few weeks ago, I came across a video on Invidious (YouTube/JXdLzinnqms) which shows a homemade modification to a smartphone.\nThe video shows, and the linked discussion on cover is thought out.\nI immediately had the desire to create something like this but, as I searched, I started to think that this type of cover is no longer produced by anyone\u0026hellip; it was absolutely impossible to find one, not only at a good price, but at all. Neither online nor in physical stores.\nSince there was no hope, I tried to change my strategy slightly and look for a very small Bluetooth keyboard, but without any strange supports such as covers included: just the rough keyboard, I would have made my own arrangements to attach it to the phone.\nThe search on Amazon was absolutely fruitless, meh. On AliExpress, for around €13 there was the keyboard I was looking for, but for me buying there is a hassle to say the least. Luckily, however, one of the many all-purpose housewares (those that sell billions of films) in my area had the product I needed, for just €2 more than I would have paid for it at Ali.\nA bargain, so I bought it.\nAfter purchase At home I took it to charge for a while and tried it on the fly. What can I say, it worked and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find the feeling when typing bad, even though we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a membrane keyboard.\nSo everything is fine.\nOr so it seemed.\nThe next morning, I try to turn on the beautiful little object again, to do some more tests. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t turn on. That? As? I put the keyboard back on the charger, and it actually works after two minutes.\nHow strange, yet I kept it charging for hours the day before. Maybe it didn\u0026rsquo;t charge well from my PC port, so this day too the keyboard remains charging, this time from the block I use for my cell phone and other devices.\nInvestigating oddities The next morning, same issue. Whatever the case, it\u0026rsquo;s evident that the battery is taking a heavy drain, out of nowhere, for some reason. For the record, the keyboard has a physical switch, which I never forgot to turn off after putting the keyboard away\u0026hellip; all very strange.\nI decide to let it charge a little, then disassemble it, and measure the voltage of the lithium battery soldered to the board with a multimeter, which I notice drops by 0.01V approximately every 10 seconds. Oh.\nAssuming the board is properly designed, so that the physical ON/OFF switch cuts the current between the battery and the board where it should, and that the battery management circuitry isn\u0026rsquo;t a dud, a problem like this is to blame. it can only be one: the banal old age of the battery.\nIn fact, not only was the battery visually quite swollen, but it has a date on the outside: \u0026ldquo;2015/8/27\u0026rdquo;, almost 8 years ago.\nI would swear that the keyboard itself is even older, considering the references to a slightly earlier era present on the box and the instructions: iPhone 4 and pre-7 iOS, Galaxy S4 and a visibly very old Touchwiz, Windows Mobile 6 and Windows 8 desktop, Symbian 3, the PS3\u0026hellip; well, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while.\nBad ending What can I say. Should I have expected a problem like this? Maybe yes. Surely, however, I doubt that other people in my place would have expected this.\nFinally, the only thing I can say is that this article should not have come out; or rather, not with this end. I should have talked about the already made Prototype 0 of my smartphone stand that adds this tiny keyboard, but, unfortunately, I feel like I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a chance to test it enough.\nHoping to be able to solve the battery problem (but I think so)1, in the next article, of what I believe will be a series, I will explain how I fixed everything, and I will illustrate the curious Prototype 0.\nUpdate 2023-03-21: I was passing by here, fixing some internal things in old files, and I thought: even if in the end I haven\u0026rsquo;t (yet) written any articles about Following this, at least one update note here is worth writing.

Hundreds of thousands of particles everywhere, shapes, colors, attractive music, this is its formula. It has some flaws, such as being particularly heavy for a Tetris and having controls that aren\u0026rsquo;t terribly responsive, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it should be thrown away.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nA month ago, in the [post of October 18](./2022-09-18- Quando-Metto-Mano-Io-Spacc.html), I briefly said that it was the DSpacc, and what a new mess I had caused.\nWell, this time I did even worse; to understand the proportions, it is good to brush up on what I had written for a second.\nThe card I mentioned has arrived, the software modification to improve it works, and I\u0026rsquo;m still exploring it all a bit. I will have time to talk about everything in a long article, which I am already writing (but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much longer it will take me).\nWhat is important to talk about now is a problem that arose\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t even know exactly when, but I only noticed it now: the L back button was causing some problems.\nI saw that pressing key combinations to access the flashcart system menus had no effect. Getting suspicious, I decide to download a homebrew to test the keys, Diagnose (which can be found from GameBrew.org [[archived page](https:// web.archive.org/web/20220818023822/https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Diagnose)]), and I actually confirm that the L button does not respond to inputs.\nOn Nlhlehde\u0026rsquo;s chat they advise me to soak the button in alcohol to clean it, and then give it some exercise - or, if I wanted to repair it correctly, unsolder the button and put a new one on.\nAt that moment I get bored of opening the console, but I see that two minutes of exercise magically makes the button work again. The operating state, in reality, lasts just a few minutes, and was questionable at the time: on average, 1 click out of 3 was recorded.\nToday I finally decide to disassemble the DSpacc, to see if I can do the service on the key. To my surprise, I see that this is sort of raised from the side; one of the many GND pins has desoldered, while the only one that closes the other side of the circuit, you can barely notice, has broken.\nNow, it cannot be said whether the problems registering the presses were due to the externally smashed button, or to internal problems that have nothing to do with the initial malfunction of the button (and the final destruction occurred due to my pressing the button a hundred of times a minute to make him exercise).. what is certain is that alcohol is not enough to fix 😅.\nInitially, I try to solder just above the broken leg, which in itself should solve the problem; unfortunately, the side of the pins is so short, and the button in such an awkward position (since we are talking about a back button), that the solder on my pin touches a little next to it and shorts the ground. This makes the key always pressed, and therefore it\u0026rsquo;s even worse (my flashcart menu doesn\u0026rsquo;t open if any key is pressed at startup!) than what I had before.\nI try to fix the soldering a bit, but no, I can\u0026rsquo;t improve anything.\nAt this point, I think about desoldering the button, because anyway\u0026hellip; and it works fine, perhaps due to the size of the SMD device, small but not too much: the board has remained clean.\nTime to take a new button from the many I have aside, even if much larger than the dorsal one on the DS, and solder it.\nOh well, enough, I\u0026rsquo;m bored of going around it any more: I try to solder a wire on the main contact, but the solder doesn\u0026rsquo;t stick. The DSpacc PCB is deadly, oh. I try and try again\u0026hellip; and in the end the metal pad to solder on comes away. A classic, dare I say, always ends like this! 😑\nWas it better to have a back button that works with great difficulty, or is it better not to have one at all? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to know. The fact is that now I will have to find solutions to the numerous problems resulting from this bad story,\u0026hellip;,,,..,\nP.S, update 2022-10-20: I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a photo of the broken button disassembled, before throwing it away, why not?

There are those who will call me exaggerated for even having the thought of doing something like this, but there is little that can be done.\nIf nothing has gone wrong, the Onion service can still be reached at this address: onmfrk2acl4xdeawfjg3nfepq7gcufolctmhiwwxpcknazus5bxzxhqd.onion{: style=\u0026lsquo;Color:#a060c0;\u0026rsquo; } sitoctt2fxjvx3lc2iqqef2aeulflprjaasv2xl4zi7sxxbmvjy5b5yd.onion[^ New aesthetic domain].\nThe idea - apparently successful - was to use a free PaaS service, Replit, to do everything.\nThis way, I don\u0026rsquo;t further burden my improper server. For months now, precisely since the beginning of mid-February 2022, I have been using a Switch console as a server for too many things: in addition to the historic SpaccCraft server, I have my own Matrix instance, some Telegram bots which are perhaps the things that require the least resources, and software assorted minors. Yes, Nintendo Switch on which I started Ubuntu..\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go into details, it\u0026rsquo;s better to do it in a separate article, but in short the reason is that SBCs like the Raspini, to date, due to current world events, have scary costs, and the Switch was the only low-cost computer consumption with enough RAM (4GB) that I already had at home. You have to adapt.\nThis here is also the very first post I write on the postocto blog, who knows how it goes and above all who knows when it will pop up, because I should fix my static site generator for a moment to be able to manage pages like this which, instead of common pages, should be treated as subpages of the \u0026ldquo;Blog\u0026rdquo; page (autogenerated).\nHow? Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the discussion of the postoctt: with Replit, taking as a basis a Repl found around that demonstrated how to host another type of service on Tor, I built my Repl which: at each new start, downloads locally everything needed to compile and deploy my static site (from my Git repos), prepare everything, and start an HTTP server and the Tor daemon, which acts as a proxy by exposing the HTTP server to the outside via the Tor network. Then endlessly, all through Git, download any updates to any of the parts and, when necessary, regenerate the site.\nI leave here the link to a GitLab snippet with my files, for anyone who wants to do the same service as me for their own website, perhaps built with my very low quality static site generator (at a code level, if I was disgusted on a conceptual or practical level I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be developing it slowly yet): gitlab.com/-/snippets/2338457.\nWith free PaaS services like Replit, however, there\u0026rsquo;s a little problem: there are limits on software execution times. In the case of this platform, everything goes into suspension if the project\u0026rsquo;s web address does not receive pings for I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand how many minutes. If it receives any later, it wakes up after the time necessary to redo the startup operations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a shame however that, apart from the fact that it would mean making anyone who wants to visit my site wait at least 30 seconds for the first connection to be established, it is the HTTPS address on the Replit domain that must be contacted, for obvious reasons not the Tor address. And having people connect via the HTTPS address defeats the purpose of having a Tor site (which I\u0026rsquo;ll get to shortly, I swear).\nThe solution would be to use, on a computer that is always on at home, a script or a cronjob (rather, a systemd timer, given that it is precisely because of systemd that classic cronjobs today are broken and malfunctioning) to continuously ping the address of the my site on Replit. I could do it, but I would like to find a way confined to the same free PaaS services to solve the problem, as something like this would mean that even those who don\u0026rsquo;t have a server at home can do what I did.\nInitially I tried with UptimeRobot, but it seems to be a problem, I set everything up in the evening, and the next morning my site was offline.\nSearching around I then found several sites (called \u0026ldquo;pingers\u0026rdquo;) that invite you to enter the address of your Replit project to make it ping continuously so as to keep it active. I used like 3 at random, that I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember, and since then the sitectt doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to turn off anymore.\nOr, perhaps, the merit was that I created a second Replit project, which has the sole purpose of pinging my first one endlessly (while the main one always pings the second one). I don\u0026rsquo;t know, because the second one seems to always shut down, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any exposed HTTP server, I have to investigate..\nWhy? Let\u0026rsquo;s immediately get the elephant out of the room (which is already small): the desire to set up a site that contains immoral material at serious levels (which I differentiate from illegal material per se), which if hosted on the traditional web would be very easy to tracing back to the owners with all the consequences of the case, is not the only sensible reason for wanting to use Tor (or any other network based on the same technical principles, but Tor is for better or for worse the most famous and used).\nThis site is also on the clear web without any problems, that is, it has no problems being there.\nTor provides strong anonymity compared to the unfiltered Internet. The reason why it should be of interest to those who do not traffic in illicit content is quickly explained not with an answer, but with a question: do you happen to want to make known what you do (including visiting a particular website, like my blog) to multi-billion dollar corporations? that in return they will not give you anything, indeed they have no scruples about doing everything possible even to your detriment (tracking) to profit in one way or another?\nHow do you want your ISP to know about the particular Internet services you contact? Or have the person hosting those Internet services identify you (me and my ISP if it\u0026rsquo;s something hosted in my house, otherwise the particular provider for servers provided by companies, like Replit itself or GitLab.com where I host the site on the clear web ), if you won\u0026rsquo;t gain anything from it?\nFor many people, for some reason, this reasoning doesn\u0026rsquo;t add up, but few care and, although I don\u0026rsquo;t go to some extremes, I understand the points of view of the few people who want to maintain as much anonymity as possible even when they do moral and moral things. online lawyers. Accordingly, I agree with and encourage the use of Tor to access the services and content I provide.\nI still don\u0026rsquo;t convince you? So listen to this. Tor allows, for example, journalists who live under total or partial censorship regimes to report the truth, whether directly or not. Or, it allows those living in these regimes to inform themselves freely and uninfluenced by government propaganda, and to communicate with other people in other parts of the world.\nThe real principle that it is easier to hide who you are and what you do on an individual level in the midst of a huge crowd, rather than when you are with a few other people, also applies to distributed networks: more people use them, even for simple web browsing, the safer individual users are. So, by using Tor to surf the web, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t care about anonymity, you will help those in need.\nAt least help the users who don\u0026rsquo;t do anything wrong: the criminals who sell drugs and weapons, or sell photos and videos depicting rape or torture, often go to their heads, and end up neglecting the opsec to such an extent that sooner or later they end (and I would say that I enjoy this) more than badly.\nA doubt that may arise for non-super-experts, however, is why it is necessary to also provide the site as an Onion service, given that any content on the normal Internet is still accessible behind Tor, which in that case will work more like a traditional proxy . The problems here, however, are more subtle, and have to do with the nature of the classic Internet infrastructure.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I need to explain the problems arising from passing data in unencrypted form via the Internet: information can not only be stolen (which for a public blog is not a big problem), but even modified and presented as if nothing had changed, with disarmingly easy, from any of the intermediate parts of the connection, for example the ISP of the client or the server.\nHTTPS for websites solves this problem.. Bad. We don\u0026rsquo;t talk about it much, but the entire correct functioning of these protection systems depends on a complex global metaphysical infrastructure, which has more flaws than you might think.\nSearching on Whoogle, I found this PDF, which more or less gives a quick look at the problems HTTPS suffers from: [Weakest_Link_in_the_Chain.pdf](https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/archive/docs /Weakest_Link_in_the_Chain.pdf).\nWhat is essentially important to say is that the entire current system, based on CAs, consists of trust in an upstream authority. Without going into details, so I refer you to the PDF, the system is fragile and can be broken, resulting, in rare special cases, in the same problems as non-encrypted connections; indeed, perhaps even worse, because the presence of HTTPS can lead us to trust always and in any case: modern web browsers have conditioned us to ask questions only when we see the open padlock or a warning triangle, not when we see the closed shiny green padlock.\nWhen you use Tor to connect to sites on Tor, the connection is not only routed between even more nodes on the network, but the data is encrypted with a public and private key system between the client and the Onion service server: the only the weak point in the chain is the server itself, which stores the private key, there are no other authorities to trust.\nThe system has problems, I will absolutely not deny it, starting from the fact that if the private key is stolen, thieves can impersonate the site and at that point the only thing to do for those who manage it is to change the key, thus also changing the domain, you cannot go to the CA to revoke the certificate. This is how a system based 100% on mathematics and 0% on trust works.\nTo tell the truth, I would therefore be making a mistake in using someone else\u0026rsquo;s machine to host the Tor\u0026hellip; Greve site. Alright.\nIn conclusion Tor is by no means perfect: it has various types of flaws, generally based on the deanonymisation of users because that is what 3-letter agencies are interested in, but let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it clearly: it is a step forward towards having more protection, and it is certainly a huge step forward towards data security, in a way that ensures that communication between client and server is only as secure as server and client, without worrying about the minutiae introduced by any third party.\nThe fact that Tor is financially supported at least in part by the US government however, without going into too much detail, perhaps carries some profound dangerous implications. This is why I want, more or less soon, to give a chance to services similar to Tor but different from it. Lokinet inspires me, to tell the truth, I think it will be the first alternative network I try.\n🏷️ Notes and References ","date":"June 29, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-06-29-%EF%B8%8F-How-and-why-sitectt-on-Tor/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nOne thing I did months ago that, so far, has proven to be a winning choice, was install a Linux-based operating system, in persistent mode, * on* a small USB stick.\nThe reasons why I wanted to do it initially are perhaps simple and banal, but it gave me, upon careful analysis, some unexpected advantages that were much more than welcome.\nWhy was the pen needed? The initial need for the key arose months ago from the fact that, in the computer room at school, I had to, like everyone else, log in to my GSuite account to access the virtual computer class. This apparently simple thing, in my case, hid two obstacles:\nMy password is dozens of random characters long. I allow myself this because I use a password manager (for all my accounts), but typing by hand every time is painful; Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t trust the school\u0026rsquo;s IP address, and would ask me to confirm access, but as they haven\u0026rsquo;t added any security methods to the account, they ask me to add a phone number. Just because he asks it in this way, with a clear excuse, I will never give my number to Gluglu: it makes no sense, if bad guys stole my account username and password, they could simply verify the latter with their own number, and according to Google it will be clear that the account belongs to them\u0026hellip; but I won\u0026rsquo;t go further. I could have used any pen drive, with a portable Windows browser downloaded on it, containing my Google session saved from home, with access logged in with my IP address, and I would have solved the problem.\nI could have, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been fun.\nAnd this is where the idea of ​​the key with an entire operating system emerged, bootable on any x86_64 PC, totally independently of the internal disk of the PC in question.\nChoice of hardware First, I thought about the memory I would use.\nIn terms of ability, I\u0026rsquo;d like to say that I did it just for the challenge, but the truth is that, on the few very large pen drives I have, I keep other files, which I have to keep on the pen drive, and moving them onto many small pen drives is annoying and brings to future confusion. So, I took one of my 2 GB pen drives, and I told myself that I would make do with it (and, spoiler, I was right, even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy).\nIn terms of speed, I only thought about avoiding stuff with levels lower than those of USB 2.0, because in any case I don\u0026rsquo;t have any fast stick available. My only stick with a USB 3.0 bus (correctly detected by Linux as USB 3.0) is as fast as a 2.0\u0026hellip; Damn Kingston.\nI have fast microSD cards, but my USB adapters for those cards are all slow.\nIn short, I take the trusty 2 GB USB 2.0 stick, mint color (it would be perfect as a Linux Mint installation media!), also from Kingston, and off I go.\nChoice of software Once you have chosen the stick, the choice of distribution Linux remains, perhaps even more important.\nHere, not only are the popular distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Pop!_OS, Manjaro, \u0026hellip;) too big to fit leaving room for a persistent partition, but they would be unusable due to the slowness of the stick.\nFortunately, I had a path in mind that I could follow, because, in the past months, out of my curiosity, I had learned something about the world of lightweight Linux distros.\nIt was a time when I had just become interested in Alpine Linux, for its ideals of lightness and minimalism. I even used it on desktop for a few weeks.\nIt was responsive and snappy, thanks also to the presence of musl libc instead of the now bloated [GNU libc](https://en.m.wikipedia .org/wiki/Glibc), but the need to sometimes configure small things by hand, even after the initial installation, led me to move away from it. However, I thought it would be suitable for a system installed on small, slow storage, with few applications.\nI then installed it, including among the essential software (as well as video and audio servers): Window Maker (a lightweight window manager), [Firefox](https:/ /firefox.com), and smaller GUI applications, including: a terminal emulator, a file manager, and a text editor.\nAll in all, it worked well and quickly but, despite the few apps installed, the memory was overflowing. This would give me some problems later: for example, there was no space to put Minecraft and play SpaccCraft, which I wanted because it can be useful.\nThis - together with the fact that later I thought that, perhaps, encrypting the pen drive would be necessary to protect my data against theft or loss of it, but my attempts to encrypt the already installed system failed - made me stop for a moment to reflect_.\nSince I would have had to reinstall the system anyway, I took the opportunity to change distribution.\nAlthough in the past, when I tried a little something, it had given me some trouble as a persistent system, I decided to give Puppy Linux a serious chance.\nThe base image of the latest version of Puppy (at the time of writing, 9.5) weighs just 400 MB, but includes a fairly complete desktop system in itself, with dozens of preloaded applications for the most varied needs.\nHow can it be so compact but full of stuff at the same time? Thanks to the use of SquashFS, a read-only compressed file system, which supports extremely efficient compression algorithms such as [LZ4](https:// en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)) and ZSTD. In fact, if it were completely decompressed, the image would weigh around 2.5 GB. Even the choice to include more minimal applications, however, contributes a lot, if you consider that practically all Linux live CDs use SquashFS, yet those of more traditional distributions weigh several GB.\nTo date Puppy is the distribution that I still have on the flash drive.\nExcept for a few minor problems (like: how the hell do I connect a Bluetooth keyboard??? and well, now I don\u0026rsquo;t need it anymore_), it works very well and is fast in every way.\nHaving set up the LUKS encryption on the writable partition, now my data (personal files and browser sessions) are protected against any accidents.\nThe built-in window manager, JWM, is also very clean and I quite like it - although I wish it had some window alignment function (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to has anything, or am I wrong?).\nAnd now, finally, I have enough free space; and I also have Minecraft!\nBackground credits: pixelartmaker.com/art/becdd8955dc57eb\nImportant benefits Well, with this magical little pen I have solved the problem of accessing Google, but I would continue to use it even if I no longer need it for that purpose.\nThe reasons, all important advantages, are as follows; some apply to live Linux in general (even amnesiac ones), others apply only to persistent systems like mine - all, however, are relevant when using a public PC:\nI have a system that adapts to my tastes, that I can carry in my pocket and use on any PC, without ever having to reconfigure anything (except, sometimes, the BIOS settings) . The system in question, contrary to what I could find on the vast majority of PCs around (Windows), respects my freedoms, and does not end up my data in the hands of a monopolistic corporation which, in exchange , it would give me absolutely nothing: on any PC I use, even those that aren\u0026rsquo;t mine, I remain consistent with my values. The secrecy regarding what I do on the PC at that moment is much more certain, as is the security of my data: you are only right to be wary of any operating system installed on public PCs, there could be any spy tool installed (and, in fact, this is the case on some of the PCs at school: there is a remote desktop control program designed for schools, [LanSchool](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/ wiki/LanSchool)). I have all my essential data always with me, whether they are simple documents or open sessions on different apps (like the always convenient Element, for messaging and exchanging notes and small files between my devices). Some particular software, such as Minecraft Java (which, apparently, may not work on some Windows PCs, because perhaps the GPU drivers do not work correctly, and Windows does not have the OpenGL emulation software from [Mesa] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_(computer_graphics)) system level, as opposed to Linux), should always work! I have an excuse to indirectly remind people that, even in 2022, USB sticks are relevant, even ultra-low-end ones. Some insights I can conclude by saying: you too should adopt a persistent Linux stick, if you sometimes use PCs that aren\u0026rsquo;t yours, you won\u0026rsquo;t regret it! In truth, I tell you, do it even just for fun, if you have some disused USB stick in a drawer :)\nHere are the websites of some distributions that I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention in the text, but which I have tried in the past or think are worth checking out:\nSpaccCraftGo - Puppy Linux rebranded from Spacc Inc, with the inclusion of SpaccCraft in the system; Slitaz - 50 MB live rolling release system; Porteus - Live distro based on modularity; antiX Slax 🏷️ Notes/References ","date":"May 7, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/2022-05-07-The-unexpected-advantages-of-the-Linux-stick/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nA few months ago I bought a small monocrystalline solar panel online, with dimensions similar to those of an A4 sheet, for the figure of around €20 (on Amazon.it the sellers are all thieves, on Aliexpress it would have cost a little less).\n![Screenshot of a photo sent in chat. The photo shows the panel in its cardboard box. The caption reads \u0026ldquo;❗️ ENEL hates her! ⚠️ Find out how the Spacc Goddess began the slow but profitable path to energy independence! ➡️ @spacccraft\u0026rdquo;.](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Screenshots/ SpaccCraft-975.png)\nElectrical doubts The panel declared, in the title of the advert, a maximum output power of 7.8W.\nIt has a USB output port, clearly maximum 5V. Still in the details of the advertisement, but in the technical specifications, there were indicated 1A at 5V output\u0026hellip; which would be 5W.\nConsidering that the panel is declared to be 7.8W, and 5V photovoltaic cells do not exist, but 6V cells do, it is assumed that it should be able to output a theoretical maximum of 1.3A of current.\nThe output voltage, however, as we said, does not go above 5V, so a conversion is involved (impossible, considering that the panel itself is a slab less than 1mm thick, and the protruding part with the USB port will be just 15x10x5mm.. there is no space), or a trivial voltage truncation, where the excess energy does not translate into a greater output current, but only in little heat..\nAnd therefore we have a maximum theoretical output of 1.3A at 5V.. i.e. 6.5W.\nLife advice.. This preamble, apparently useless, is to remind us that low-cost cinema cameras with zero documentation (this thing doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a manual or writing on the back!) can only be trusted up to a certain point, beyond which to solve the problems In case of doubts, it is necessary to rely on the use of other china machines.\nIn my case, a USB multimeter, to be placed between the panel output and the input of a device capable of absorbing enough current. I don\u0026rsquo;t have this little object, and I realize that I would be wise to buy it (it\u0026rsquo;s cheap anyway), because at the moment I can\u0026rsquo;t have any certainty about the performance of the magical silicon slab.\nField tests Thanks to both the need to test the full possibilities of the small panel and the desire to make use of it to reduce my parents\u0026rsquo; electricity bill by 0.001% (and satisfy a tiny part of my individual electricity needs with totally clean energy), I so I started doing simple practical tests in the field (the balcony of my house).\nThe very first test To tell the truth, I did the very first test away from home, the day immediately after the product was delivered because, for unrelated reasons, I was actually away that day. On that occasion, the only one out for now, I only tried to recharge the battery of my smartphone (6000mAh).\nI did 3 different tests, the first two lasting about 15 minutes in the few hours before midday, when the sky was clear, with the panel held by me in my hand to make it better catch the sun perpendicularly (ideal for a monocrystalline).\nI first tried to charge the phone while it was on, stalled and with all the radios off (but not in Android\u0026rsquo;s deep sleep state), but unfortunately there was no way, the phone consumed so much energy that it was unable to recharge, it could only discharge slowly. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember very well, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t think of recording the data, but it seems to me that, on the app I use to see the charging statistics (AccA), only on the 300mA input.\nTrying the same formula immediately afterwards, but with the phone turned off, it seems to me that in 15 minutes it only charged 2% of the battery\u0026hellip; it would practically take 12.5 hours to charge from 0 to 100% if this is the case.\nI did the last test around 2pm, when the sky had unfortunately darkened. I placed the panel on a surface and used the phone normally, listening to music and I think using online messaging apps. As I suspected, it didn\u0026rsquo;t recharge, but at least it was almost without running out of charge, which is still good considering the weather conditions.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look further.. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s say that the very first test, outside with the phone, was a bit of a failure.\nHowever, without losing heart, in the following days I carried out other tests, all from the balcony of my house, some of which I will now give a rough overview of, because they were done once and with little data at hand.\nThe panel seems to be able to turn on my NodeMCU even with very little light, and I had no doubts about this, a microcontroller absorbs very little current, we are talking about tens of mA on average.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t tested any loads, but not that there can be any that big, the maximum you get with the NodeMCU is 250mA when you turn on the WiFi.\nOn a day with annoying clouds that come and go, another phone of mine (with a 3100mAh battery) manages to charge, but with difficulty, especially because when the phone enters or exits charging (and it happens in these light conditions), the screen turns back on and wastes energy.\nWhen turned off, it is even worse, because the screen always turns back on at maximum brightness and for longer. I found this last detail funny\u0026hellip; basically, charging the phone when it\u0026rsquo;s off in this way is worse than charging it when it\u0026rsquo;s on.\nOn a more or less OK day, but still a modest day at the end of winter - beginning of spring, I managed, in this case too, not to load but to download a little more slowly, my first generation Nintendo Switch console (the one with the least efficient SoC), with Ubuntu turned on and the software working.\nSomething that there is little to say about, but which is undoubtedly a victory, is that at least I can charge my power banks.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried 3 of my 4, clearly the smaller capacity ones load sooner, but in any case all of them fill up well without any problems. One that I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much it is, the memory would tell me 4000mAh, it recharges completely in just over a sunny day. A 5000mAh one, in maybe a day and a half.\nBy charging these small batteries you can then easily charge or power devices that do not have enough current if connected directly to the panel, such as my smartphones or\u0026hellip; a Rasperino.\nSolar Rasperino? We are finally at the end of all this ambaradan, with my tests on a Raspberry Pi 3B.\nThe idea popped into my head after I unfortunately left the magical product unused for a while, not knowing what useful things to do with it. I mean, I bought it because it\u0026rsquo;s definitely useful to have a little thing like this in emergencies, but if I can put it to good use in the meantime, that\u0026rsquo;s even better.\nI thought, first of all, of configuring BOINC on Raspbian, a distributed computing software that can be used to contribute to scientific research projects, while earning a few cents a month (rip) in a kind of cryptocurrency, the Gridcoin .\nAs I already said, the Raspino must be powered by the powerbank, the panel directly does not give it enough current. It seems to turn on, but in reality it seems to go into bootloop.\nWell, I won\u0026rsquo;t beat around the bush too much: while (with the same powerbank, I think 4000mAh) for some low-load applications, like Pwnagotchi, the Pi can stay on for hours even with a backlit LCD screen connected\u0026hellip; the CPU at 100%, doing complex calculations, eats so much of that current that the battery flattens out in just 1 hour.\nPsssss.. if you want to see other photos of the panel (3) and in a slightly more decent quality, I put them on Pixelfed: [pixelfed.uno/p/octo/426839557817260168](https://pixelfed.uno/p/ octo/426839557817260168)!\nThe reality of the facts Apart from this thing, which even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me money in practice would be useful as it is beneficial for scientific research, I have no practical uses in mind for the Rasperino Pi 3 Solare. Maybe a Pi Zero would be better: apparently, other people in the throes of madness (but better equipped), thought of using that to mine Bitcoin, with a small panel similar to mine ([YouTube/CbpfNU7oaws](https://invidious.snopyta .org/watch?v=CbpfNU7oaws)).\nFor now, I use the small panel sporadically to charge my power banks, which I discharge when I happen to use them around to charge my smartphone.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s anything I learned from this story, it\u0026rsquo;s that I should buy the damn USB multimeter.\nI should have done it almost 4 months ago, but instead I\u0026rsquo;m procrastinating so as not to spend money.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-%EF%B8%8F-Rasperino-Solare-and-other-experiments-gone-wrong/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Not having made it in time for the 30th, here I am posting late at night, before mimir. 🌌\nIn recent months I haven't had the opportunity to deal with the site perfectly, because my words have been stolen by alternative outlets, or perhaps a little blocked by setbacks. And what exactly, I imagine you might ask yourself who diligently follow the CTTT site, but only the CTTT site, and otherwise never wallow in the scam?\nThe BBS, Spacc forum with an ancient flavour During this summer I had a slightly unusual idea, at least by 2023 standards: opening an old-fashioned discussion forum for hustling, with the vague idea of ​​building something that could slowly grow into a place ideal for discussions of that kind, taken beyond the practical boundaries permitted by the most modern social platforms or chats. And here he is proud, there on https://bbs.spacc.eu.org/\u003c/ a\u003e. 😎\nI have some moderately ambitious future ideas regarding the Spacc BBS, which I have not yet had the opportunity to complete and/or set in motion, due to issues of skills and time; from the connection with ActivityPub, to the multilingual support with translation in the backend, up to the idea of ​​a role-playing game that would take place in the forum with ad-hoc designed code (in short, a real video game, not like on other forums where people talk and we pretend to play)... and who knows if I will ever be able to accomplish everything, especially not being able to find people capable of providing the pieces that I am missing.\nHosting the forum costs me nothing, whether it is used or not, and for this reason alone I don't think I will ever declare bankruptcy or close down. It's really so convenient to host at home.\nAlthough I have not exploited it to extreme levels, I have used the BBS to write some posts that otherwise I would perhaps never have launched, because I feel that in some way the forum format (even in those cases in which no one queues the thread even after weeks of waiting...) offers me a particular way of expressing myself, which I would sometimes feel unsuitable on the blog.\nOn the other hand, who knows, maybe having only the blogoctt I would have published there, feeling that the MicroBlog certainly would not have been a suitable alternative. Speaking of which...\nThe brand new MicroBlog, so much for Du Rove The \"MicroBlog\" that I have on the ctt site isn't really a microblog in the classic sense... it's a category that I arbitrarily decided should keep my shorter posts. I have always practiced real microblogging a bit on the Fediverse, a bit on Telegram, with a channel that historically has continuously switched back and forth between public and private for complex reasons.\nAt the same time, these platforms have always also served as \"PicoBlog\" for me, with posts of one or two sentences, while I let the dust form on the section of the site. 🕸️\nOn the one hand I had tried to move to my own site for these things, because I wanted to have a way to really control my data and the management of publications... but with the static one it was all quite inconvenient, and the desire to publish I got over it. On the other hand, a small problem was my having to choose every time between publishing on Telegram, and therefore often not being able to effectively share my words even outside that bubble, and publishing on the Fediverse, being able to replicate the posts on my channel only with obnoxious limits (which lowered the experience and made people complain). At the end of the day therefore, months ago the desire to micropost began to wane more and more... and I don't know exactly how I spent my days then (perhaps administering the technical side of the forum...), but I started posting more rarely. Just this December, however, everything changes, after one night I can't fall asleep immediately, but on the other hand I remember that...\nThe ActivityPub plugin for WordPress should have made some decent progress by now, and could almost be suitable for microblogging... ...and it just so happens that I have a WordPress site on Altervista (therefore, unlimited space and traffic but with complete WordPress, free) in disuse, which would be perfect for trying this little thing... This thing perhaps deserves a separate article, but the fact is that I immediately put this way to the test to change my microblogging workflow for the better, after having flaunted it on the new MicroBlog note (https://octospacc.altervista.org/2023/12/04/138/ , this is for example the message in question). 🔗\nBillionaires' platforms leave everyone stranded As luck would have it - ironically, on the evening of December 24th, as if it were a bad, rotten gift - the Telegram account where I was the admin of my channel and of the comments group was banned, for reasons that we still haven't understood (clearly automatic, and in my opinion incorrect). As it is, it also seems that I have lost all my data forever: if they don't respond to my manual request for data portability, they will have violated the GDPR, and in the meantime I will be left with nothing in my hands (if I I'm not freaking out...)\nLuckily, having started publishing from WordPress, the ban didn't interrupt my shitposting flow in any way (phew!), but I had to waste some time catching up with people (and there are those who don't we have still collected) to finally take it to the Matrix (a federated and truly free messaging protocol)... because unfortunately they didn't want to listen to me when 2 years ago I said that it would be wise to move there before accidents, not after. 😮‍💨\nThis stuff also deserves separate discussion, and just for good luck I'll leave some of my new links here:\nThe discussion about the ban on the Spacc BBS (with references also to some very hot MicroBlog posts, I went crazy live): https://bbs.spacc.eu.org/viewtopic.php?t=160 The Matrix spacc \"space\", which I've never really had a chance to promote before, you might find it hilarious if you join: https://matrix.to/#/#Spacc:matrix.org I dismantle everything However, all this also means that it's time to review some little things on the site.\nThe section that is now called MicroBlog there is no longer right - because with this name it wasn't right before - and I have to either remove it (by pouring all the posts present there into the Blog), or rename it. I would lean towards the first option, so as to reduce for a moment the fuss that I would otherwise have to make when deciding when an article was long enough to be in the Blog, and when it wasn't. At the same time, the PicoBlog will disappear (becoming an archive, I don't delete anything). I didn't update it before anyway, and even more so I doubt I'll ever use it now. The eternal return of the Knowledge Base I'll try to be brief here, because by now this issue risks becoming the biggest inside joke of my life, which, just look at it, equally deserves the elusive separate article. 🫣\nFrom more than a year ago, as I also wrote on the ctt site, I started using TiddlyWiki to create my own knowledge base of... I'm still not clear on what.\nLet's say that above 90% are lists of links that are useful to me, of which 30% perhaps with short personal notes, and the remainder of the content made up of small pages of notes and things like that that I wouldn't really know where to throw otherwise. It's public because it's convenient for me, it would be more inconvenient to keep it private, and I think it can be useful to other people, just as the personal wikis of other random individuals have been useful (or at least interesting) to me.\nThe point is that, since I've been using that little thing, I have practically no reason to update the non-blog pages on the ctt site, because it's just more inconvenient and less organizeable in the long term, compared to creating them from scratch wiki.\nAdding to this also the now having to recognize the failure of statioso (the generator of my site, which is a spaghetti, difficult and annoying to extend), but while my complaint about the fact that I can't find other generators that are satisfactory for me remains true, the idea of ​​transferring everything to TiddlyWiki comes naturally to me (which, yes, works excellently as a generator of static sites)... 🙂\n...It's a shame that it's not easy to recreate all my special pages and particular internal functions with the templating and macro system of this otherwise magnificent software, and so I've been working on it since March 2023. In all honesty, what happens is that I work on it for days, then I stop out of boredom, then I forget about it for a good month, and then I start the cycle again as late as possible.\nAt this rate, who knows if sitoctt and OcttKB will ever truly be merged into one source... they will finish the bridge over the strait first, those there, this matter about me. 🙃\nThe time that passes away... This section risks not making the slightest sense, but I wanted to write it anyway, partly for atmosphere and partly out of desperation.\nThere has never been any doubt that time cannot help but flow, leaving behind everything that has been past and that constitutes the present because there has been no way to change it. However, time seems to be less and less useful, more volatile, less tangible. Entropy rises, regrets crystallize, divertissement appears to be an increasingly less effective way of escaping trouble.\nBut, dramatic jokes aside, this is what I really feel, especially when external circumstances remind me of it: speaking in the short term, despite having eliminated some of the things that led me to waste time, it seems that I have less and less available; regarding the long term, every now and then there is a strong feeling that the time really available to materialize, despite all the justifications that my brain invents to eliminate the pain, is almost running out. 😶\nThe end. Let us therefore hope - because it is generally right to never stop hoping, even if perhaps it is not a good idea to use hope as a substitute for action - that this new year can bring us many equally new but truly beautiful things, even if I have no idea how this could happen. Happy Holidays, little people who live in my computer and read my crazy things!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-The-report-of-this-2023-at-least-in-terms-of-posting/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nFor almost 7 years I have had an Acer laptop, Aspire V3-572G, undoubtedly now a bit old, without praise and with some infamy.\nWhen it was purchased, it was essentially a mid-range notebook like any other, without any notable features. I mean, I used it quite a bit and it more or less always did what it was supposed to, until about 2 years ago I started demanding to use heavy games and development tools, at which point the new (desktop) PC was great. obligation.\nThe current state All in all, with GNU+Linux as the operating system, the Intel mitigations not installed (yes, I actually deleted the microcode, rather than blocking its loading), and a SSD installed in place of the HDD years before, the machine is still more than good for many activities that today I carry out primarily with the desktop PC.\nThe Intel [i5-5200U](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/85212/intel-core-i55200u-processor-3m-cache-up-to-2 -70-ghz/specifications.html) itself still grinds well, and the 4GB of RAM isn\u0026rsquo;t a huge issue if you have a light system stack and aren\u0026rsquo;t keeping 50 programs open at once.\nA little problem Where are the infamies, I hear you thinking?\nFor at least a year now, my use of the laptop has dropped significantly, because an initially small problem has, all of a sudden, become enormous.\nThe smasher Going in order, - I don\u0026rsquo;t remember precisely, but we\u0026rsquo;re talking about at least 3 or 4 years ago, when this was my only personal PC - the problems started when the W key stopped working, over the course of a few days. Az.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true that I\u0026rsquo;m a Linux user, and that at the time I was also excessively gamer, but I never hammered that or any other button, contrary to what the stereotypes about my categories may tell you.\nThe lesson to be learned here is: if you are at home, and therefore have the opportunity to use an external keyboard, it is better to use that to play, otherwise over the course of a few years you will completely burn the key you use (in many 3D video games). to move forward.\nThe funny thing is, like I said, the button broke within a few days, not right away. Initially it only became hard to register the pressures, which inevitably led me to press harder and harder, until I evidently broke through it.\nAcer shit? I\u0026rsquo;d say, Acer shit.\nBut, it seems, all laptop manufacturers, even the big, famous ones, often mistakenly associated with quality just because of their fame, too often churn out products with terrible design or construction errors. The laptop that unfortunately happened to me, as we understood, was no different.\nThe consequences At this point, the PC had become only slightly inconvenient to use in some situations.\nThere were no big problems on my desk, I connected a USB keyboard and that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the story.\nIn other situations, typing the W (you don\u0026rsquo;t need a sledgehammer to write in Italian, but you do for many other things) began to require the use of the on-screen virtual keyboard, with the mouse to press the W, which would then start to do the rounds of CTRL+C and CTRL+V whenever I needed.\nIn any case, from that moment, the use of the notebook keyboard reduced, both because I used an external keyboard when possible, and because a little later I assembled the new PC and started using the laptop less in general (difficult do otherwise, when there is comfortable space on the desk for only one external keyboard, which for obvious reasons must be connected to the fixed PC).\nWhat is very strange is that, since about 1 year ago, despite little use, many other keys quickly started to fail, out of nowhere. I can\u0026rsquo;t say if any other keys then completely died, but certainly at least 60% of the keyboard started to want beats to register the pressures.\nThis is where my laptop use plummeted.\nI realized Just a few days ago, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, perhaps because with the desktop PC I don\u0026rsquo;t even have the convenience of moving to another room to use the computer - something I would like to do to escape the terrible heat that develops in my room in the summer - it occurs to me that I would like to use the laptop.\nI spend like 30 seconds thinking about why the idea unconsciously has a bad aftertaste for me, and then it occurs to me\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll quote verbatim what I wrote on my Telegram channel (which I use as a microblog) at that moment.\nHm, I just consciously thought: \u0026ldquo;but why do I practically never use my laptop even at home where it\u0026rsquo;s convenient for moving from one room to another?\u0026rdquo;\nThen I remembered that like half the keyboard doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\nAcer Shit Incredible how, because of the broken keyboard, I unconsciously began to develop a sort of passive repulsion for my (only) laptop, slowly stopping using it If only it were easy to buy a replacement keyboard\u0026hellip;\nRightly, in the comments, a person points out to me that I should have easily found the replacement keyboard I need on Amazon.it and\u0026hellip; he wasn\u0026rsquo;t wrong.\nI honestly should have bought it right away when the W broke, but, trivially, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I didn\u0026rsquo;t. My memory tells me that I didn\u0026rsquo;t find it on Amazon at the time, but honestly I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much to trust. And in all this other time I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it.\nThe replacement keyboard arrives Without wasting too much further time, I made sure to order it (3 days later, but it could have been much worse), and after 2 days it was already at home (earlier than the reported delivery period). 20+7€.. well spent? It\u0026rsquo;s a must see.\nI think the price of the keyboard is right, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the shipping price \u0026gt;:(.\nThe keyboard was only available in black, and everything else on my PC, including the factory keyboard, is white instead.\nThe chances of something horribly bad coming out are high, but I\u0026rsquo;m a Linux user: I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to fix my broken laptop for a long time instead of telling people it\u0026rsquo;s the best computer you can use; Imagine if I care whether it\u0026rsquo;s bad or not, if it works it\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nThe replacement I don\u0026rsquo;t lose heart, and I begin to unscrew the countless screws that hold the laptop\u0026rsquo;s body together, and I separate the plastic sections. Then I disconnect the 3 flex cables for the power button, keyboard, and touchpad, and lift the upper part of the body. Nothing new, however, I already had to do this procedure when I installed the SSD.\nAfter this, however, other screws. Damn! All these screws, and it becomes a mess to put everything back in place. No more screws.\nBut we must continue. Once the screws (damn!!) that hold the keyboard together have been removed, between the external plastic support and the internal metal one, you can remove the old keyboard and put the new one on, and then do everything else in reverse.\nOr almost.\n![The plastic (external) and metal (internal) frames, which serve to hold the keyboard together, are separated](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Repair-Aspire-V3-572G/Keyboard-Frames-Disassembled. avif)\nChores \u0026ldquo;while I\u0026rsquo;m at it\u0026rdquo; Since I was there, I also wanted to take the opportunity to clean the fan and its filter a little, which over the years have accumulated dust, allowing less air to pass and thus allowing the CPU to reach a good ~50°C in idle .\nI thought more powder, honestly, oh well.\nI also checked the thermal paste on the fly (perhaps too quickly).\nTo do this, I had to turn the motherboard upside down, after removing even more screws. You could see some of the paste outside the CPU perimeter, and what little I saw didn\u0026rsquo;t seem particularly dry. I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know how often the thermal paste should really be changed unless it\u0026rsquo;s very dry, so I left it alone.\nShould I actually have unscrewed (what a pain!!!) the heatsink from the processor and seen what the paste was like there? I don\u0026rsquo;t care, no more screws.\nThere would be another problem, which I wanted to take advantage of to fix, but about which there was no way to do anything.\nAlso many years ago, the tip of a faulty audio cable broke, getting stuck in the 3.5mm jack port of the laptop (damn!!!!!), and all my poor attempts in the past to remove it from the outside have always failed .\nUnfortunately, even internally, the door is an almost completely closed piece of plastic, so my idea of ​​inserting something into the internal perforated part also failed, because simply there is no hole. Maybe nothing will happen if I create the hole with the right tool, manage to push out the stuck piece and the door works as it should again\u0026hellip; but, for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it alone.\nYou can see that I will continue to use the USB sound card (€6 on Amazon) to use earphones, as I have done for years now.\nWork finished! With a bit of difficulty, I put everything back together, and admire the new state of the PC - which among other things, in idle after startup, now that I\u0026rsquo;ve cleaned the fan, reaches ~40°C, I would say definitely better than before !\n![The laptop reassembled and turned on, with both the new keyboard and the old one (placed on top) visible, as well as my desktop](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Repair-Aspire-V3-572G/Laptop- Reassembled-Acceso.avif)\nWhat can I say, you can see that I use GNU+Linux.\nNot only does the laptop now have an ugly aesthetic contrast (but at least it works!), but in the photo you can see what the old white keyboard looked like: filthy and yellowed. Oh, at least it matched the theme of my terminal emulator, light solarized - it did and doesn\u0026rsquo;t anymore, unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit sorry.\nRegarding the old keyboard, I must make it clear that I lost the plastic of the W key after the key itself had already broken, so don\u0026rsquo;t go saying that my keys break because I start detaching them: the truth lies in the exact opposite.\nThis is also why I won\u0026rsquo;t try to remove the black markers from the new keyboard to put the old white ones in their place\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the risk of breaking a few keys.\nSmall bonus: a photo of the bottom of the old keyboard.. the W key is actually broken.\nThe right choice To conclude: the keyboard, from the little I have tried it, works well, except for a few keys (like SPACE), which seem a little hard and not very elastic (but which can still be pressed).\nI only regret not buying it sooner.\nA curious detail, but which absolutely doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me think I\u0026rsquo;ve made a wrong choice, is the fact that an area of ​​keys on the left is not exactly level with all the others. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a problem in practice but, aesthetically, well, it makes me laugh.\n![The leftmost keys (W to F) of the new keyboard, appearing just slightly sunken inwards at one corner](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Repair-Aspire-V3-572G/Keys -Sunken.avif)\nDon\u0026rsquo;t throw away your laptops if they have some small problem that can be solved easily and cheaply.\nIf the keyboard breaks, you change that; if Windows becomes unbearably slow, install a Linux distribution (GNU is recommended, but not mandatory!) that meets your needs.\nBy doing so, you not only save a lot of money; electronic waste, the so-called e-waste, is reduced and therefore a minimum amount of good is done for the environment.\nNote: Some of the photos in this article are available in JPEG, less compressed, on my Pixelfed profile: pixelfed.uno/p/octo/451398427740616761\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-How-I-fixed-my-laptop-with-25/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s Web is unquestionably very different from that of 20 years ago, and it changes more and more with each passing year.\nLooking at the positive sides of progress is always very easy and reassuring, and for this reason we rarely think about the dark sides which, in many, many things, exist. The Web, unfortunately, is one of these.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s happening? The Web of documents is taking a turn for the worse, slowly becoming, to all intents and purposes, the Web of apps.\nTo understand the problem, however, we must remember what the World Wide Web was in its infancy. It was an Internet platform for exchanging information in the form of hypertext, that\u0026rsquo;s it. And what are hypertexts? Some documents. Of course, very particular documents, where reading can take place in a non-linear way thanks to hypertext links, and the Web in particular has evolved to be a hypertext system with support for decorated text, multimedia elements, and highly advanced layout\u0026hellip; but at the basically we always talk about documents.\nIn the very early days of the Web there were only so-called static sites, meaning they always remain the same (unless updated by those who administer them), and there is nothing that users who visit can do to change them. This category includes things like a simple blog, the site itself for example, a news site, the demonstration site of a company or product, an encyclopedia\u0026hellip; in short, simple things of this type.\nA little later (days or weeks, the idea was already envisaged in the very first specification of the Web and HTML) the idea of ​​using servers that could process information entered by users with buttons and text fields, interact with database, and essentially provide a user-generated content experience. Therefore, forums in a more classic sense began to appear, sites for creating sites (!) in a simpler way (CMS), the social networks closest to us, webchats and, let\u0026rsquo;s not forget, search engines. These are the dynamic websites.\nIn this period, however, it did not matter whether we were talking about static or dynamic sites, only documents returned to the computers of any user who contacted the site. Whether it was the HTML page itself, a CSS file to stylize the page, or multimedia files (at the time only photos) placed between one block of text and another, to the browser, the program that interprets and displays these documents, only documents to be interpreted returned, not programs to be executed.\nHere we are still in the exclusive existence of the Web of documents, for the Web of applications we will still have to wait.\nWith these last sentences, those who think ahead have already understood where I\u0026rsquo;m going with this, but I\u0026rsquo;ll get there calmly. In this era, essentially nothing much could happen to your computer or your information simply by loading a given Web page, because the browser only had to deal with files that told you how to lay out the text on the screen (HTML and CSS, markup languages), or how to arrange arbitrary colored pixels on the screen (images).\nThe only thing you had to trust was the browser itself (and that it was up to date), not individual websites.\nThe current state of affairs Then, came the scripting. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen all sorts of things, but in the end only JavaScript has survived to this day, and is the basis of the pioneering (and tragic) Web 3.\nWeb scripts are actual programs that a browser can execute if loaded from a page. Here, however, an obvious problem arises: you have to trust every single website that integrates scripts, a problem that is however decidedly complex to deal with.\nTo be honest, this is not the only problem: scripts very often slow down pages, especially on older and less powerful devices, and on some very old stuff they don\u0026rsquo;t work at all, thus breaking sites that use them extensively. In practice, this means that sites that unnecessarily choose to integrate JavaScript are, on any hardware, often much slower than those that don\u0026rsquo;t.\nHowever, we will discuss this in detail another day.\nFirst of all, there are sites that upload obfuscated code, to all intents and purposes proprietary software\u0026hellip; those, only with a lot of patience and enough experience can you understand what they do. In any case, however, the simple fact that a program is free does not mean that it is necessarily free from privacy and security problems, and this has been seen, ironically, especially in the JS community, where developers of popular libraries have gone out of their way and integrated malware into their projects. Few open software developers put code that is harmful to users in their programs, but, those 2 or 3 out of 10000000 who do, sometimes get away with it, because there are no other people who bother to read the code and take action adequately.\nThis is a problem that concerns all users of the Web, and if those who already have the ability do not go, for obvious reasons of time and patience, to read all the code of the scripts loaded by all the sites they visit, imagine that those they just don\u0026rsquo;t have the ability to do it (the vast majority of users) are hopeless.\nMany people have problems - some sensible and some not, for those who know a minimum of how a modern computer works - installing native applications from scratch, perhaps never heard of before\u0026hellip; all problems that are ignored when you are simply browsing the Web, without knowing about the hundreds of scripts that run in a varied browsing session.\nHow can a script, and therefore a site that integrates it, be malicious?\nBrowsers today execute website scripts in a fairly sandboxed environment, of course, and as of today, for reasons that I won\u0026rsquo;t explain now, even serious flaws emerge every month, if you keep the browser updated the security is in theory fine.\nPrivacy, however\u0026hellip; that really ends up bad. There was a demo made as a game that showed personally why you need to be afraid\u0026hellip; too bad I can\u0026rsquo;t find it anymore, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember where I discovered it from, and therefore nothing :(. At the moment, for those who want to find out more , I can only link Device Info, which shows many of the data (but not all) that a website can extract from the devices of those who visit it. Maybe also take a look at Cover Your Tracks.\nThe problem here, it must be specified, does not lie in web apps that can be defined as real applications, which use JS to function. Whether it is a calculator, a game, a word processor, a photo editing app, we are always talking about applications, no matter whether they are written in native language as native apps for a specific platform, or whether they are written in JavaScript as applications for Web browsers. All of these things require the client to execute the code, because these are very interactive apps, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. I myself often use apps that run in a browser window.\nThere would then be a long discussion regarding the Web as an application development platform, for many reasons (even the flaws), positive and negative, but I will talk about it in the future.\nSmall digression: one way to quickly identify whether a service on the Web is conceivable as a document or necessarily only as an app, which I find intuitive, is this: just ask yourself (assuming there is no music or images): \u0026ldquo;the general content of this site would make sense if printed entirely on paper (even if it would no longer be hypertext), or not?\u0026rdquo; If the answer is yes, then we are talking about something that can easily remain as a document, and we must be wary of anyone who claims otherwise.\nDoes the content of a forum make sense if printed in a book, a magazine, or a simple leaflet (objects commonly considered documents, even if physical)? Certainly, as well as that of a blog, a social profile, a chat room, or the results page of a search engine.\nHowever, printing a calculator or word processing application makes no sense (at most, only printing data, entered into that app or obtained from its processing, makes sense).\nThe appization disaster The real problem lies in the fact that non-directly interactive websites, which we previously categorized into static and dynamic, are increasingly becoming apps, but without any valid reason.\nMore and more frequently I see more and more sites, which should be simple documents, not working properly without JavaScript. We go from news sites where the article doesn\u0026rsquo;t load, to blogs where the navigation menus no longer work, forums where message sections are not visible, forums that don\u0026rsquo;t load at all, new search engines that absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t work without JS ( and which present themselves as a private alternative to Google, it\u0026rsquo;s a shame that Google works well even without running proprietary scripts and these don\u0026rsquo;t!), and even social network sites that only show a blank screen if the JavaScript is not loaded.\nThese services that I have listed can all be classified as documents and, apart from very particular cases, such as those sites that encrypt and decipher client-side data deliberately to ensure that the server cannot read them (see [PrivateBin](https://privatebin .info) for a notepad, Element for a messaging app), can work fine without scripting and should (at least optionally).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like speaking against free and open software written in their spare time by enthusiasts, who perhaps don\u0026rsquo;t even earn money from it, but one thing that struck me negatively is that the plague of appization has also hit the Fediverse and its platforms.\nFor those who are unaware of this new virtual universe, I will say in short that it is an idea and, in practice, software, based on common protocols, to guarantee universal compatibility and interoperability, so that those on platform A can also communicate with those who are on\nMastodon and Friendica, at least for viewing profiles and their posts, or discussions with all messages, treat those who love the Web of pure documents well and, although their interactive applications do not work without JS (Mastodon totally, Friendica partially) even if they could, we are already at an excellent compromise.\nIf a person is not part of a certain instance, but wants to see content knowing the link, he can do it without fear, because he only has to load static documents in the trusted Web browser.\nThen there are other platforms, Misskey, Pleroma, and Pixelfed come to mind. These here, to allow you to view anything, require you to have JavaScript.\nMaybe you can even trust the authors of the software themselves, there are only the usual 10 around, but how can you trust when you find an instance you\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of before and managed by who knows who? Simple answer: you can\u0026rsquo;t; although in theory one could check which scripts the instance loads and whether they conform to the original version (or, in the case of a fork, whether the changes made are really the ones documented), no one will do so, for the obvious reasons of which we talked about before.\nThe problem of the unverifiable authority of the code, clearly, becomes even worse for individual websites, not necessarily based on any known finished software, and which therefore have no real counterpart to make a comparison regarding the state of the code.\nOn the Fediverse, I say that the question particularly strikes me because I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect it. Honestly, from Big Tech, which relies on spying on users to earn money by selling their data, I expect a progressive abandonment of the Web of documents in favor of that exclusively of apps even just for reading a few paragraphs of text (which is happening, but slowly), considering the very large potential to subjugate users.\nFrom those who develop software for communities that are concerned about some of the new privacy issues on the Web, and who therefore use less popular alternative software, I absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t expect it.\nIt will all end in tragedy The situation, I fear, can only get worse. Although I am more than sure that my words and actions will not change the future at all, given that I believe in what I say and, incidentally, at the same time I also create content and services for the Web, I do what I can to create my things as I would like to see them everywhere. So for non-interactive sites, following the progressive enhancement technique, I first make sure the basic stuff works without scripting, I use scripts the least possible and, if I really have to, I do it for optional functions and features, and I try to keep the code (within my limits) compact and readable.\nI personally appeal to you who are reading this.\nIf you build websites, consider taking what I\u0026rsquo;ve said into account, I beg you.\nIf, however, you only browse, perhaps try to start blocking JavaScript in your browser (Chromium integrates this as permission for sites, of which you can set the global setting to Blocked; on Firefox you must install [NoScript](https:/ /addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/noscript)), so as to keep JS deactivated for sites you don\u0026rsquo;t know, and have the possibility to activate it temporarily or permanently for domains that don\u0026rsquo;t work or that you already know and are aware of trust me. Not only will you browse more securely and privately, but with less slowdowns and loading!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-Documents-should-not-become-applications/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a technical table!\nBefore Now Total weight of site sources 40 KB 548 KB Total weight of the site compiled 24 KB 660 KB Total lines of code in static 261 1314 First of all, the entire site in source form took up just a few dozen KB. Normal, the pages could be counted on the fingers of a severed hand and they weren\u0026rsquo;t who knows how rich.\nNow, however, we are at half a MB excluding all multimedia assets (except the favicon).\nEven static, my static site generator that I started developing at the same time as the CTTT site was nothing special: just 250 lines!\nNot that the current 1300 are many - not at all, and it\u0026rsquo;s better that way - but the growth is visible.\nHowever, if, with an image (ignoring that my font didn\u0026rsquo;t load, even though I had already included it at the time), we see how the site was in practice in its first days\u0026hellip; ahhh, but how rough some of the details were , compared to today?\nMy rambling speech still appeared more or less as it does today on the home page, but the rest is barely recognizable.\nEverything seems emptier\u0026hellip; since all the little icons and buttons that I now have at the edges and in the global menu are missing. Yes, the latter already existed; its usefulness in those days was almost nil, considering that the pages present were number 2, but let\u0026rsquo;s say that it was a good thing to have created it immediately.\nThe placectt The writer in the center of the screen, however, has something wrong with her.\nOh yes, there is a curious little anecdote - perhaps not necessary, but for me it is because I\u0026rsquo;m in charge here - which needs to be told properly.\nThose who followed the creation of the site in its primordial days already know this, but the site lived under the name \u0026ldquo;postoctt\u0026rdquo; for a good 2 weeks.\nIn the initial moment of imagining this thing, in fact, the platform did not exist in an exact and defined way. We thought about the \u0026ldquo;place\u0026rdquo;, but in a vague and still confused way.\nIn the end, predictably, I settled on a website.\nFor some reason though, the name \u0026ldquo;postoctt\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t stink to me soon enough. It took me a long time to realize that that name was reminiscent, at least in part, of something related to the post office\u0026hellip; A situation, I would say, not exactly optimal.\nSo, I thought about changing the name to \u0026ldquo;sitoctt\u0026rdquo;.\nOctt\u0026rsquo;s site The only really important thing, however, has never changed: \u0026ldquo;occt\u0026rdquo;.\nAt the end of the name there is always Octt, that is me. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s a site, a place, a post office, what matters is that it\u0026rsquo;s mine; and speaking precisely of this, of the fact that the site is mine, there is a lot to say.\nThe site is mine because I have complete freedom to make it the way I want.\nIf already in the mid-90s the only real limit for a website was the creativity of the person who built it, today the potential of the Web platform are truly infinite; although, in a certain way, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem that way at all if you only frequent the common Web.\nThe sites of the \u0026ldquo;non-personal\u0026rdquo; Internet all have the same same and banal appearance.\nMany blogs or demo sites use recycled graphic templates. Modern social platforms (Mastodon, Friendica, Pleroma, and so on and so forth) limit customization to a photo, a banner, and a description. Stuff like Misskey already does more, but it absolutely doesn\u0026rsquo;t reach the levels of total customization, with granular precision, that only a site The Web - even if it were a forum like those of the past, and not a private space - allows.\nGreat expressiveness And here\u0026rsquo;s another of my desires that unconsciously condensed itself as the purpose of the site: creating something that I felt was missing not only for what affects me, but the whole of the community of Artisanal web in general.\nThere are several other sites founded on this idea, of using the Web with tools, including manual ones, to express one\u0026rsquo;s personality, creativity and imagination, but: almost none are in Italian (one day I will talk about this too), and in any case I am pleased to contribute to the growth of what can be considered a global collection.\nWith websites you can choose in the smallest details animations, colors, backgrounds, fonts, arrangements, alignments, categorizations, embellishments, interactions, but always remaining in the field of documents.\nReally nice is the fact that with handwritten CSS, even just a few dozen lines, you can already establish a unique graphic identity. Then the real bulk of the code only translates into minor (but still appreciable) details.\nLeaving aside the means: this, the idea of ​​creating a collateral gallery, was one of my initial goals. In recent months I\u0026rsquo;ve left it aside a bit, in the sense that I\u0026rsquo;ve mainly focused on creating content, thinking that ✨ the sparkling details ✨ I could put them when it happens.. and I should start doing it, honestly! At the moment only the home page has great particularities, if we exclude the overall style of the site which I have worked on with a minimum of regularity.\nThe importance of content Not that it\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing to put content first, anyway; in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. A site without real content and not regularly updated may perhaps be a piece of art if made to be beautiful or to have intrinsic meaning - but in itself it is not useful.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s something you find, admire, maybe share\u0026hellip; and it all ends there. It is the content that gives real meaning, that guarantees a long life for the site, and keeps the public coming back from time to time.\nThe organization Contents which, for goodness sake, must also be decently ordered.\nI try, it took me a long time to arrive at what I have now, with a global menu that first of all includes fixed pages, such as the home page, because they have no specific category or because they are of particular importance.\nImmediately following this, I have a list of sections, which I wanted to call \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo;. They are links to pages that contain lists of any other page of the given topic. This path is also circular, considering that, from the individual content pages, you can click on the automatically generated entries to visit the pages of the relevant categories.\nFor now, there are perhaps a little few pages in the classic sense. I won\u0026rsquo;t repeat them here one by one because well - but even if I did, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to create a wall of links. Their particular reason for existing is told on them.\nThe real bulk of the site is in the blog articles.\nFor me there is a conceptual division to be respected between the two types of pages. Traditional ones can be something incomplete, always updating, work-in-progress by nature; the article pages should instead be created once, properly, and then ideally never touched again. I can create the normals as a draft, and update them a little whenever I want; the blog ones, however, remain private while I write them, and then, when they are finished, they become public. The latter require me to work more in the moment, and therefore they come out more rarely, but they are more loaded with content.\nDigging up some things New little things, made especially for the site, I have put and will put many, but the idea is to fill the place with even old stuff.\nSome non-exclusive content is still already available in my other places on the Internet - in some cases without a license - like perhaps on my Mastodon profile; others, like very old posts from my Telegram channel, are archived and inaccessible except to me.\nThose not archived are simply messy and poorly preserved, as well as without guarantees for those who want to copy or reuse them; those, however, which for one reason or another are archived, it is as if they did not exist for the world, and it is easy for me to lose them too.\nSome of this data may have value, so this is unfortunate.\nLike a month ago I announced with my decretocto (you didn\u0026rsquo;t understand a thing, right?), this is something that requires tedious work (taking the old one, evaluating its quality, copying the text, paste it into the new text files, layout it well, download photos and videos, optimize them well and upload them\u0026hellip; nothing but the fun of creating, here it\u0026rsquo;s an assembly line!), but it has to be done.\nWith my free time I have already started doing it, and I will continue.\nPosts from my old blog should also be archived here, again for organization and preservation - but those are easier.\nTo conclude: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter which ones, but in any case the contents are the meaning of the site. They are, however, only because they are freely available to anyone.\nWhat does this really mean? Anyone who has read home should perhaps know this. I don\u0026rsquo;t dare add anything else, in any case; you will have to wait for a next article, one in which I will pick up the topic where I leave it now.\nYou too are the meaning of the sitectt.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nFor a strange set of reasons, this article sat in my drafts for more than a month, even though it was practically finished. Oh well, better late than never, happy reading...\nSo: somehow, one day my mother's name day mysteriously arrived, and I therefore found myself wanting (having to?) give her a gift.\nBut what gift to give? It's always a mess with these things. Even at the Chinese housewares shop, that magical place where if you turn around you discover things on the shelves that you couldn't see before, sooner or later, the gift ideas run out. Let alone elsewhere.\nFortunately, although I lack good taste, I believe I have plenty of creativity, and for this reason once again my only real option was do-it-yourself. (But I bought the raw materials from the Chinese anyway, and where else...)\nI enter into housewares without having too precise ideas in mind, but with the plan of wandering around a bit, seeing objects that are more or less dissonant with each other, and waiting for my brain to invent something.\nIn the end, I bought two items:\nA set of 10 paper clip style hair clips; of slightly different colors, to have an acceptable variety, but all in a solid color. A box of beads of different shapes, sizes, and shades of color; 8 types in total. However, each box only had about one shade of color, a slightly limiting but not serious factor. I got a set with colors between purple and pink. \u003c /p\u003e Just €3 later, I get home straight away with the desire to do the job, and I don't even start when I'm already on the verge of making a mess: when opening the little box of pearls, I was tilting it a little too much, and some of those colored crumbs ended up from one compartment to another... a little more carelessness, and I could have lost at least a good part of them across the room in an instant.\nMy idea was to place the smaller beads (~1 mm in diameter) all over the top edge of the clothespins. The larger ones are almost like pebbles (~4mm in diameter), there's no way they'll stick together at all. Especially when you are in the situation of having to do all the work in just a few hours.\nIn this case I therefore had to use hot glue, whose greatest advantage, the almost immediate grip, was however a slight flaw, because gluing these beads properly requires a certain precision; at least in the way I initially tried, that is, letting a few beads fall onto the clothespin from my fingers after placing a little glue.\nWith this method, I should have gotten there sooner, yes and no only a quarter of the colored pebbles stuck (badly), and the rest ended up everywhere. So I tried it again, this time dipping the glue-covered clothespin into the bead container, and this method actually worked a little better.\nHowever, this way is not magical in itself, and has not been able to solve other problems:\nThe beads don't hold much on the sides, where the body of the clothespin becomes thinner... promptly, after enough open-close cycles, they all come off. In general, when opening or closing the clip, some pearls will pop off even after the glue has completely dried. In any case, by doing this movement about ten times, you can ensure that those who really have to fall do so at least immediately, avoiding problems later. Meanwhile, in the frenzy of everything, I had beads going right, left, on the desk, on me, and then on the floor. While doing the opening and closing, some even splashed into the air...\nMost of what I lost I found again in the days immediately after, however, when I walked around my room and felt something crunchy under my slippers. I couldn't find a very small part, obviously, also because in the meantime I vacuumed shortly afterwards.\nIn the end, after making these 3 for my mother... I almost started wanting some made like this too though! 😅️ So I made at least one more, but this time, having infinite time, I tried with vinyl glue.\nI don't know whether the decoration made in this way is water resistant or not, because my vinyl glue is so-called \"washable\", but I don't know if it can only be washed with water or soap is also needed. I'll avoid having it rain on my head when I wear it, I guess.\n\u003c /p\u003e Despite this potential risky side, I think that using vinyl is still the best choice, for an aesthetic reason: when it dries completely, it becomes totally transparent. Hot glue, on the other hand, remains dense and visible, making the final work look dirty and messy. It's fine when I have to join cardboard or fabrics, but not in this case.\nAfter a few days of use, however, I noticed that the vinyl glue does not stick very well to the rubberized plastic of the clothespin, and it has come off slightly at the edges. Nothing serious, but it should be kept in mind; to solve this, I think it is enough to add a little more glue (vinyl or non-vinyl) which also goes around the side of the clothespin and incorporates it slightly.\n\u003c /p\u003e So, in the end, my mother had a product that was almost not even truly complete, compared to the more refined one that I created just a moment later! 💀️ Her real gift was therefore acting as a beta-tester. I then offered her to rearrange the first three clothespins a little, but she said that, at least those three, she wants to keep them like that, and at most she'll make her some more new ones. Well, I don't know what to say, there are those who prefer to use betas for life, apparently (absolutely not me about Minecraft...).\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-Hair-clips-reduced-to-glue-and-pebbles/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nBetween 1 and 2 months ago - realize how much time passed before I got annoyed definitively - the batteries in the remote control of the television that I keep on my desk (I use it as a second monitor) have started to run out beyond the limitof tolerable usability.\nBecause I didn't do anything Up until now I haven't changed them, simply because I was getting annoyed and dry, considering that:\nI have relatively few rechargeable pen and mini-stylus batteries, and I have to save them for the stuff that really draws a lot. I don't want to waste non-rechargeable batteries and contribute to, in order: The waste of house money; The global waste of materials; The waste of energy for the transport - and, when possible, recycling - of these materials; Ultimately, the pollution of the planet. The batteries in the remote control still work, although in a decidedly not optimal way. Technically \"it works\" The remote control, in fact, proves that it can still send signals to the television, but only for a moment: just long enough to press \u003ea button, and nothing more. In an instant he returns dead, and immediately trying to send other signals is of no use.\nIf, however, at this point you wait for about fifteen seconds, and then you press another key, the command goes to sign. It is clear that the batteries are very discharged, but they still have that little charge that allows a capacitor to charge slowly, and therefore at remote control to be powered. Emitting the infrared light then apparently drains all the charge from the capacitor in a few moments, and then you have to wait again for it to recharge.\u003c /p\u003e What do I need it for on my desk? Honestly, I don't need the remote control anyway. 98% of the time I only use it to turn the appliance on or off; those very few other times when I need to adjust the volume, or change the active source, I can easily use my smartphone, on which I have an application that uses the emitter integrated infrared (that's right, producers don't integrate it only as a means of playing pranks in places open to the public, but also as a useful tool). For when I have to do it immediately! The problem, big problem, when I have to turn on and off, is that I need quick access.\nI can't start to unlock the phone, look for the application icon for the remote control, and then press firmly on the display to center the power button, all with easy pigs \u003e of my Android ROM, which is buggy and slow, as if it were from Ohio (instead it is from developers in India, like virtually all Android custom ROMs).\nThe controls on the back The TV has an integrated control interface: a simple wheel that moves in two directions and you press, and you can use to turn on/off or change source.\nThe problem is that it is in a terrifying position! It is practically on the side of the rear edge, the one formed by the continuation of the plastic structure, which maintains the television circuitry, behind the LCD frame.\nPractically I would have to bend over every time, sticking my fingers between the annoying obstacles that live on my desk.\nMaybe I should be thankful that those controls are on the left edge - since I have the other screen immediately to the right, things could have been worse strong\u003e - and be satisfied... what balls... piles... no, balls!\nMy solution And so, for this outdated art attack, I take the following materials and tools:\nA pliers (absolutely not made for bending metals, but I have this), to bend: An old paper clip, of medium thickness. Scissors (with non-rounded tips), for cutting: The card of the Amazon packages. Double-sided tape. Hilarious process So here's what I went to do:\nI bend a terminal part of the paperclip to form a small ring. It serves to accommodate the protruding central part of the wheel. A little at a time, I take the measurements that the paperclip must have, and bend it accordingly: I place the paperclip on the wheel; I see how long it is at the first new detachment point it reaches on the TV body; I take it again, holding the point of interest with my finger, and patiently fold it; Repeat until the paper clip reaches the front edge of the television, passing over the side one. I notice that the protrusion of the wheel ends completely inside the ring, which therefore does not press it; then I fit a small piece of cardboard into the ring (optionally blocked with adhesive tape). In this way, something solid pushes exactly on the wheel, which is actually pressed. Since everything seems fine to me, I start cutting cardboard strips, and attaching some double-sided tape to the ends. These are to support the paperclip in different points, and not let it fall away from the button, but leaving it freedom of movement in one direction. About halfway I leave the strips clean, and crease them slightly, to leave a space in which to pass the metal wire; Keeping the paper clip in the right position, I attach the strips where necessary. (I couldn't take the less blurry photo back there, sorry.)\nWhat a job... As regards pressing the button - which I can now implement by placing my finger on the extreme left edge of the screen, without having to put my hands behind everything - this solution works perfectly.\nAlas, the rotation of the wheel is not good with this crotch, which has good freedom of movement on only one axis. In any case, the cardboard does not create excessive rigidity, so I can still rotate the wheel from behind.\nThat's it. If I were to improve my solution - which, yes, is very crude, I won't deny it because this is what I like - I will write an appendixto this article.\nAwkward questions I already know that the question will come, so I'll answer now:\nBut all those loose batteries you put in the cover photo?\nEhhh. Good question.\nThey are all batteries that I keep when they are discarded at home (not by me, since, I repeat, I avoid non-rechargeable ones as much as possible). , because very often \"discharged\" just means \"too discharged for the device from which it was replaced\". For some remote controls, in fact, they often still work, including mine in some cases.\nSo did I just waste time with today's project? Nah, I wouldn't say: from now I can easily keep the remote control a little more put away, no longer necessarily always on the desk strong\u003e, which I can therefore keep very lightly (because in an instant I ruin my own efforts!) more tidy.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-Everything-so-as-not-to-change-two-batteries.../","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

However, it is possible to keep an eye on their health status, in order to identify any problems.\nWhen it comes to HDD or SSD disks, the [SMART] protocol (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.) comes to the rescue but, if, like me, you use computers in an unconventional way, then checking out classic records isn\u0026rsquo;t enough.\nLinux goes further Something quite secret, which not many people know (so it seemed to me, at least), is that on Linux it is possible to access the statistics of partitions with some filesystems.\nThis, obviously, regardless of whether you are using a pen drive, an SD card, a hard disk, a floppy disk, or even an even less usual memory.\nExt4 provides some curious data - and so should its previous versions, Ext3 and Ext2, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t checked.\nF2FS I also saw, directly from my Android smartphone, exposes some interesting information\u0026hellip; which I won\u0026rsquo;t address in detail, because it\u0026rsquo;s all very obscure and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they mean; and if I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they mean, I\u0026rsquo;m not curious about them.

And how?\nGet the data On Linux, just browse the paths /sys/fs/\u0026lt;filesystem\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;device\u0026gt; to find some interesting files.\nYou can print the contents of each one on the screen, alongside its name, with a simple command (executed in the relevant path): for i in *; do echo \u0026quot;$i: $(cat $i)\u0026quot;; done. Unless you have SELinux active - generally, by default it is only active on Android devices, not on desktop systems - you don\u0026rsquo;t even need root permissions.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve put the most interesting ones in the table below, regarding the microSD of my server (a poor Nintendo Switch that runs Ubuntu non-stop), we\u0026rsquo;ll return to it shortly.\nName Value errors_count 0 first_error_time 0 last_error_time 0 lifetime_write_kbytes 1959125105 session_write_kbytes 1423172308 Speaking specifically about Ext file systems: to even know a few more details, and accompanied by an understandable name, there would also be the command tune2fs -l /dev/\u0026lt;device\u0026gt;. However, this requires root permissions and, while it also reports some of the data that can be obtained by looking at the files from before, such as the number of lifetime_writes, these may be out of date, and relating only to the last mount of the partition. So, better pay attention to these.\nThis time too, I\u0026rsquo;ll bring back the interesting things.\nName Value Filesystem created Mon Jul 26 04:33:17 2021 Last mount time Fri Apr 15 11:55:30 2022 Mount count 16 Things to watch for Let\u0026rsquo;s see, one by one, the usefulness of these values.\nIt must be taken into account, however, in case you have not understood, that the values ​​speak of the state of the partition, not of the storage media. We can read them only because Ext4 saves them and, consequently, if the partition is formatted, then these values ​​​​are also reset. Furthermore, we consider that they could easily be altered by anyone with simple programs like tune2fs, so they are not to be taken as perfectly good if untrusted people have access to the memory.\n• Filesystem created: The date the partition was created. Simple, but it can be useful for making health estimates, together with the next data. • Mount count: The number of times the partition has been mounted. This can be interesting, if we are talking about memory that is not used permanently on a machine that is always on. If SMART did not exist, which gives this and even more data, this value would be very useful on HDDs. • Last mount time: The date the partition was last mounted. We can use it in combination with other data, and that\u0026rsquo;s it, I think. • session_write_kbytes: The amount, in KB, of data written during the current session, i.e. since the last mount. Together with the value described just above, we can use this to know how much we have written in an active period of time (the current one). • lifetime_write_kbytes: The amount, in KB, of data written since the partition was created. This information is particularly useful about microSDs, at least if you use them intensively like me. It\u0026rsquo;s also on F2FS. • errors_count: The number of errors, I believe both in reading and writing, that occurred over time. Frequent errors can be a symptom of unreliable or simply degraded memory. • first_error_time and last_error_time: Dates of the first and last time an error was logged, respectively. It can be useful to understand if any errors occur continuously, and therefore it is necessary to investigate further; or, if a mistake happened once and then never again after a long time, and therefore you are fine like that. When is it necessary to check your health like this? Well, OK, this information is interesting, but: when is it actually needed?\nIf the storage memory in use - which, if we have decided to resort to these measures instead of using SMART, is probably a microSD or a flash drive - starts to show signs of failure, perhaps slowing down over time, or corrupting data\u0026hellip; It would be advisable at least check that everything is OK.\nIf the data isn\u0026rsquo;t scary, but seems in order\u0026hellip; then it\u0026rsquo;s time to first do a complete formatting (including recreating the partition table from scratch), something made simple by programs like [GParted](https:// gparted.org), and then you see how the story continues.\nIn any case, just to be careful, it would be a good idea to always carry out routine checks, so as to be able to predict problems before something serious happens.\nKeep an eye on microSD? Speaking of microSD cards: they are almost disposable, they have an extremely limited life, given that their memory chips are the waste from the manufacturing of other, higher-end memories, such as SSDs.\nWhat is known about their actual durability, at least of those that came out well from the factory and not of sub-brands?\nYou read all sorts of things online: there are those who say that every single memory cell can withstand 10,000 rewrites, those who say that you can at most write 1,000 times the capacity of the memory before it completely fails (going into read-only mode)\u0026hellip; no conclusion is reached.\nI have had cards like the one examined today, with a capacity of 32 GB, which, apart from the almost 2 TB written since the last formatting, in my opinion has seen at least 3 TB in total in its entire life, and yet it still seems fine; and then, I\u0026rsquo;ve had cards that started giving problems for much less. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I used the latter with crappy file systems, like FAT32 or exFAT, and for this reason they were constantly corrupting.\nIn conclusion: if we abuse betting slips, it is good to be able to control them, to the extent possible, in the way we have learned today.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/note/1-01-01-Check-interesting-statistics-and-health-of-partitions-on-Linux/","section":"Notes","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

The entire app with all your personal data is a single, self-editing HTML file, meaning you can copy and secure an entire site in an instant. It cannot save data on its own, but you have to download the modified HTML file locally each time, or use synchronization systems (I use Git, supported in-app).\nIf I started using it for the sole limited purpose of school study, but then these days I ended up starting to use it a lot also to create my so-called personal and public knowledge base, on everything I can write to the I fly in a non-linear document format that is very well suited to small, quick interconnected notes\u0026hellip; which means it\u0026rsquo;s really interesting.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a bit sorry to say it, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that part of the time I would normally dedicate to the ctt site will be taken away from it, to be dedicated to the newly created OcttKB - which, in this regard, is here on \u0026lt;https://kb.octt .eu.org\u0026gt;.\nAs much as I like everything I have built in recent months, which in fact will continue to live - both as a place in which to express my design style, and as a place in which to publish elaborate and never fragmented content - I must say that I have found a tool which manages to channel some of my thoughts well, those that the CTTT site cannot manage.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to explain too much about the technical side of the advantages or disadvantages of TiddlyWiki, because we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a software that is easy to start using, and absolutely very complicated to master (it will take me time!).\nWhat I will say is that: with its being oriented towards the arrangement of information in small fundamental elements (the tiddlers), which can then be connected to each other to build elaborate information - both with links and with transclusion (when the content of a element appears completely copied in the middle of another, which is done simply by writing {{Element Name }}) - lends itself really well to well-rounded thinking organization in general.\nAs a bonus, TiddlyWiki can be used as a more traditional static site generator: you can write elements into many files, and use the CLI program to compile everything into the monolithic file described above. The official site of the project uses this technique, but for a personal site it is not necessary and in fact, it cancels out the advantage that TiddlyWiki has, of being able to be used as a modern notes app: open, write, everything is saved in the cloud automatically.\nHowever, the CLI program has a function that I find useful: the ability to generate static versions of the site, which do not require JavaScript for navigation. This is great, and I think anyone with a public TiddlyWiki, if they have the tools, should set up a build system to automatically make static pages available on the server.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-New-frontiers/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Or rather, it was a period in which I was interested in the concept of using paper as a means of storing small computer data, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I started to feel this taste.\nFrom there, I had a particularly specific idea: to store small programs or demos on equally small paper cards. I immediately opted (and I still consider it a good choice) for the Western European business card format, i.e. 85x55 millimetres: it is standardized and elegant, with a good rectangular area and a good ratio between one and \u0026lsquo;other side. I can collect and store these cards as if they were business cards (or distribute them as such!), in binders that are easy to find and highly convenient to use. I\u0026rsquo;m just sorry it\u0026rsquo;s not part of the metric card system!\nRemembering MattKC\u0026rsquo;s feat of fitting a little game into a QR Code, I opted for this storage format. I knew and know others for saving data on sheets of paper, but they are all less ideal, for different combinations of the following reasons:\nThey are optimized for large sheets, and are not suitable for small cards, where they would be less efficient. They have a lower storage density than QR Codes, because they exist for different purposes. In theory they are promising, but in practice they do not have a working software implementation (and, therefore, there is no physical way to use them). Finally, QR Codes are definitely easier to read with better or worse hardware and software:\nHardware: a simple webcam is enough, integrated into a smartphone (ideal, they are generally of higher quality) or a PC. Software: there are many QR code decoding software; some smartphones even integrate them into the system. \u0026hellip;WIP.

So, no playing any of my physically owned DS games, nor using a flashcart. Pokémon is the only GBA cartridge I own I don\u0026rsquo;t have any other cartridges from the GBA! I only have this Pokémon one because I found it at a fair years ago and, not having any GBA cartridge but the DS already broken at the time, I decided to buy it. I\u0026rsquo;ve played it quite a bit, but I want more. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have any other cartridges or even a GBA flashcart. The fact is that, also because I had to take a photo for the WikiSpacc article, I took it out the other day. When I see it I regret not using it, but unfortunately there is little that can be done.\nMy crazy mind, however, today recalled an idea that, if I were capable of doing these things, maybe it would have even been good\u0026hellip; but that\u0026rsquo;s me.\nI thought: what if I soldered a DS flashcart in place of the slot?** I didn\u0026rsquo;t think of this out of nowhere, I saw it some time ago in a modification of the DS made by a person who does these things well . In some videos from a year ago, like this, you can see that this other form of DS has a flashcart soldered onto the motherboard.\nI take the screwdriver and bits, and disassemble the console. All OK, I\u0026rsquo;ve done this at least 4 times counting just the DS Lite.\nBut then, I arm myself with a welder\u0026hellip; honestly they should take away my gun license, considering the damage I do.\nThe first thing I find myself having to do is desolder the slot. Ouch.\nAfter cutting the non-electrical points that held the slot to the motherboard - which looked like solder points, but didn\u0026rsquo;t melt - I first started by trying to heat up all the pins slowly, pulling the slot out slightly. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. So I try to heat every single pin and remove the solder with that strange tool used to suck it up\u0026hellip; but little or nothing comes of it. In the end I go back to the initial method, but done faster and more smoothly.. what a disaster!\n![Photo of the area where the DS slot was.](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Misc/IMG_20220918_170148.avif) ![Macro photo of the area where the DS slot was.](http://http.sitoctt-assets.octt.eu.org/public/Media/Misc/IMG_20220918_170157.avif) Almost all the soldering points have come off, and now there is brown. I know the trick of scratching away the green layer of the PCB, to expose clean metal to solder on, but there\u0026rsquo;s just no room here. On this card everything is close together, there is not the slightest room for manoeuvre.\nThere are some very small holes with the conductive diameter around them (just as wide as a single copper wire), testpoint type, which actually appear to be connected to where the solder pads I destroyed were connected. Just to, I try to solder up there, but there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no way to do it. Those are small and there is no good space around them, so the pond doesn\u0026rsquo;t settle.\nI just wasted time, and once again demonstrated to myself that I\u0026rsquo;m just not capable of doing soldering work that goes beyond connecting 2 wires to huge pads (which I do badly anyway, with a dirty job).\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to buy a GBA flashcart now, and use it.. to boot DS software. To my surprise, it\u0026rsquo;s possible, and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it next time.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-When-I-get-my-hands-on-I-rock/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

But at the seaside, of course. In your opinion, who has the most authority in this regard: all those unknown people who every time, almost acting by inertia, punctually choose the mountain again, hoping that in some way this umpteenth time could be the good and fun one... or the 'very Italian poet poet, Gabriele D'Annunzio, who in particular seaside locations experienced summer months so profound and memorable that he felt the irrepressible need to write about an entire collection of lyrics?\nI have spent these days in profound quiet, lying in a boat in the sun. You don't know these places: they are divine. [...] I think about the time when I will have to get back on the train, with unspeakable regret. I would like to stay here, and sing. I have such a vehement desire to sing that the verses arise spontaneously from my soul like the foam of the waves. In recent days, at the bottom of my boat, I have composed some Lauds that truly seem to be children of the waters and rays, all penetrated by air and saltiness. I feel that in a month or two I could compose the entire volume in one go. [...] If you could imagine the beauties of this marina!\n(Letter from D'Annunzio to Fratelli Treves Editori, 7 July 1899\u003c /a\u003e)\nAlthough, like many, I am also convinced of the fact that the sea - understood as being chained in the same single seaside resort chosen for the holiday on duty - is tiring for a long time, in some cases I too am able to feel in a particularly engaging is that naturalist essence that D'Annunzio was able to transcribe with extreme difficulty into beautiful words, despite the fact that my holidays are definitely a little more flat than his.\nPerhaps during my short holiday in Calabria I didn't have the opportunity to take spectacular walks in the pine forest, or to enjoy a walk on the beach as nature dictates - without the August crowd and the sensory overload generated by it - and not even staying for hours in the absolute peace of some glimpse to rest, I still couldn't give up that one moment of immersion that I'm truly allowed.\nAfter several of those days in which I reluctantly had to decry the sea water as unsatisfactory - too cold, too rough to even stay on the shore without rolling away, overall uninviting atmosphere - finally today between late afternoon and first evening the cards on the table are the right ones, which allow me to make that most desired move: peeing in the sea.\nAt the beginning, my idea was to just stay on the shore, distracted and with my head full of other thoughts. However, in a few minutes the environment proved to be extremely enveloping for the senses, and my thoughts slowly aligned themselves with the frequency of the waves. Following this new calm and welcoming rhythm, then, I push myself a little further into that vast blue, arriving to get wet up to my waist, there in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nBy now I feel good in the water, and in the moments that continually follow one another I begin to forget all the shapes, colors, mental constructions. The sky shaded with a warm blue, a fresh color stained by the warm shades of the sun which is now about to set, thus putting an end to this last day of holiday. I do not perceive all those no longer necessary elements, works and thoughts of the modern world, totally out of place in such a divine context, and I delete those other few people very distant from me.\nWith the blink of an eye, I therefore go back hundreds of thousands of years, if not tens of millions, to when all the broth of life was being prepared in the enormous oceanic pot, inside which today we can no longer live but from which we still feel an ancestral call.\nIt is at this point that, after my mind and my skin have totally merged with the blue body, the rest of my flesh is completed in this temporary hybrid entity, which at the same time belongs to me and of which I am not Nothing. That stimulus, as old as the scenario that has naturally come together by now, is now the only definable complex thought that goes back and forth between my nervous system and the urinary system. Thus we build a need that has the appearance of a longing desire, but which we begin to realize on our own, as if it were almost a gift of fate, without any notable effort on my part.\u003c /p\u003e This. This is the single only moment in today's world when we can appreciate the simplicity of such a gesture. Deriving pure satisfaction from something that we consider obvious, and to which we generally don't give a shred of attention: all the other times we pee we always have something on our mind, and we always see the act as small as yet another chore to do constantly, not like a little well-deserved moment of break a few times a day. I am personally guilty of this.\nIn this long moment in the Calabrian sea, quite deep even at a distance not excessively far from the shore, the only even possible distraction is the infinite panorama between the horizon and it costs. No moment is ignored, but rather each of those countless moments increases the awareness of pleasure, while waiting to finish the job; but to be able to crown the anticipated satisfaction, not to run away from the cup as usual.\nThe most pleasant aspect of the work is undoubtedly the warmth of the liquid now released, which induces relaxation and gives us confirmation that yes, we are doing the thing more beautiful. The swimsuit is always in place, never moved a millimetre, but you can't feel it at all, it doesn't offer the slightest resistance to the mixing of the only two fluids in play. It's the highlight of everything, the pinnacle of panism.\nIn the end, everything ends, but that's good. We, extremely limited beings, could not even appreciate an experience of this type in this situation if it had a different duration. At this point, with extreme calm, without starting to fill my head with useless thoughts again, I start to get out of the water, which has become certain. I enjoyed this special moment, and that's what counts.\nFinal rating: 10/10. An experience that in its pleasant essentiality is truly inimitable. I highly recommend it to everyone, and I would certainly do it again at the next available opportunity.\nBefore concluding, a little curiosity: the sea is the oldest bathroom not divided by gender in the world. We humans did not invent this particular tertiary category of waste disposal places to remedy the mistakes of some of our ancestors - nature invented them, well before the very first homo sapiens existed! p\u003e","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-%EF%B8%8F-Review-Pip%C3%AC-nel-Mare-Tyrrhenian-Sea/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.\nThis story, more practical than ever, is incredible in my opinion.\nNot only does it demonstrate what lolis can get to with too much free time, like me; shows how everyone among us has a kind of \u0026ldquo;social fingerprint\u0026rdquo; that, if not adequately disguised, can identify us.\nImportant notes Before starting, however, I need to clarify a few things.\nSince the only thing I want is to share a story that I think is interesting and has some food for thought - and my hobby is not to ruin people\u0026rsquo;s lives - some details are omitted from the story, while others are invisibly altered, in order to to respect the privacy of the subject of the story. His old and new names will literally be replaced by \u0026ldquo;Deadname\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Censored\u0026rdquo; respectively.\nEverything, however, will become clear as you read.\nA special memory So, this story actually began at least 8 or 9 years ago.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly when, but let\u0026rsquo;s say that around that time I discovered Deadname. He created content on the Web and, other than the fact that I really liked it, there\u0026rsquo;s not much more to say.\nSome time later, much to my chagrin, he announced that he would stop making new stuff. From one day to the next he said that the social spaces that were his current domain at the time no longer represented him as a person, or something similar.\nFurthermore, a little later he also made his old content disappear from the internet.\nAt the time I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the slightest idea of ​​what he could mean by such a speech but, looking back with my current knowledge, both about my person and what I discovered to be his, I understood perfectly what that sentence meant.\nMeanwhile, even though Deadname had become just a past memory, the years continue to pass and the Earth continues to turn.\nOn some occasions, her character comes to mind, not only to me alone, but also to other people who remember what she was.\nFor example, sometimes a friend of mine and I, speaking in private, since we were first and foremost in this personal situation, joked by saying things like \u0026ldquo;Deadname deleted everything because she had to settle\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd so, every time, she laughed. If something like this, thought and said at random based on nothing, had ever proven to be true, then we would have officially become Official Universal Based Distributors of redpills.\nA (seemingly) new personality Anyway, back to the present day; a few weeks ago, precisely.\nAs practically always, I was at the PC, doing things and seeing them on the Web. At a certain point, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember exactly how, I came across a profile of Censored, which I found to have some interesting things.\nI decide to watch a video of him and, immediately, as soon as I open it, there is some detail that takes me by surprise. The voice, in particular, strikes me as inaccurately modulated. It\u0026rsquo;s a concept I can\u0026rsquo;t exactly explain. In short, we are talking about that kind of modulation which in many people does not raise doubts apart from \u0026ldquo;this voice seems strange to me\u0026rdquo;, but which in me, having a similar personal experience (but I would say more unsuccessful), makes one think \u0026ldquo;but this person is transgender?\u0026rdquo;\nEvidently, however, at that moment I had more important questions in my hands, because, among all his public profiles, I decided to just quickly look at the biographies, some original textual posts, some reshared ones, some photos including some selfies, and just a few second of other videos.\nI found no indication, even veiled, that he might be transgender. I get annoyed immediately, close everything, and go back to mine.\nJust a few days later, I come across Censurato\u0026rsquo;s profile again. A different video catches my attention, so I start watching it.\nThe more I listen to the voice, however, the more familiar everything becomes. In just a minute I understand that, the voice itself, the way of intoning it, and even a little bit of how the video was made\u0026hellip; everything, everything had an aftertaste of Deadname, despite the two characters being of practically opposite genders.\nThe investigations begin I decide to let her friend know this immediately before she, curiously, says she thought the same thing.\nThe stakes this time are really too high to pretend nothing is happening, so we start via chat to collect elements, of any kind, that could coincide between Censored and Deadname, cross-referencing everything we can obtain about the person, and the little that we have more left.\nWe start with interests, which all seem to match, even the strangest ones. Even the taste in niche memes seems the same.\nEven some personal and social details - such as about his family, his cultural status, or the area in which he lives - are consistent with Deadname\u0026rsquo;s past (even if only my investigation partner remembered these details, I didn\u0026rsquo;t).\nSome content still available online, because it was created in collaboration with other creators, was useful in refreshing the memory of further small details, about her childhood for example.\nBig shot! All these discoveries, however curious, could very well have been a series of coincidences.\nHowever, we did the really big coup, which removed all doubts, because:\nSome particular physical signs, compared between photos of Censured and a few deleted videos (but which we have kept for years!) of Deadname, match perfectly;\nOne of the online services used by Deadname at the time keeps a publicly accessible history of all username changes made; the account that was created with the name Deadname has changed its name over time, to Censored.\nCase solved And it is exactly like this, with both small and large details that fit together perfectly, that the puzzle is officially complete: the two characters investigated are the same individual.\nThe redpill said without knowing, therefore, turned out to be such.\nI, however, have no idea why Censurato had to necessarily embark on this undertaking to cover his old tracks. I understand, now, why he wanted to delete his old contents: because the character that appeared in them no longer corresponds to who he is today in terms of gender - but I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why pretend that the past never existed .\nI would say that I am quite happy to have found again, after so many years, even if as a slightly different character, the same person who managed to entertain me in the past, and I am happy that he still has the passion to do what he did well.\nThe social digital footprint This story - which I would say has a happy ending, because I have revealed an important mystery for me - has a clearly visible dark side: it can be said that it proves the existence of a social digital footprint, as I like to call it, which every person has.\nWith this term I mean a truly unique identifier, which allows anyone who wants, if the basic conditions are met, to identify a specific person always and in any case, despite any partial changes in identity.\nI see this imprint as composed of everything that is objectively true about a given individual: the things he likes, the things that have shaped his personality, his social connections, his bodily characteristics, and the things he does or has never done, as well as who knows what other elements that I now forget.\nWe are not even talking about something strictly linked to the online world, clearly, even if in some cases, as we have seen now, some things about us that touch the Internet form strong elements of the imprint.\nHow to protect yourself As long as you are not doing it to escape, so to speak, the consequences of complete immorality, wanting to reset your social footprint, to live in the world as a totally new person, is legitimate; that\u0026rsquo;s why I protected the identity of the person in the story.\nBut then, how do you do it?\nProtecting yourself from tracking is possible, but it is not at all simple. Just as to protect your computers from web tracking you need to use browsers like Tor Browser which - when communicating with other computers - omit some data and mask others, to protect your personal identity from social tracking you need to avoid sharing too much of yourself with the world, even going so far as to lie if necessary.\nIt is undoubtedly impossible to hide what some of the things we are passionate about are, if we have the desire to share them with the world, and perhaps discover like-minded people.\nOther things, though - for example, what relatives you have, the name of your first pet, what places you frequent, or how your passion for something began - if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to erase your past and carry yourself as a totally new person, it\u0026rsquo;s better not to tell them out loud.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/1-01-01-%EF%B8%8F-How-our-social-digital-footprint-screws-us/","section":"Blog","summary":"Caution\nThe content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano.
