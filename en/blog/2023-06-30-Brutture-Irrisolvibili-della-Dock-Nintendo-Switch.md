<p><small><em><strong>Note</strong>: This article <strong>should</strong> have first explained the Switch dock issues, but then continued and ended with <strong> >total development of my alternative solution. The first part was quite long, however, and I'm afraid that it might <strong>eclipse</strong> the really important part, that of my <strong>dangerously original</strong> solution. So, <strong>in this</strong> article I only talk about <strong>my problems</strong>; what comes out <strong>later will be</strong> dedicated to my <strong>do-it-yourself</strong>.</em></small></p>

<p>Whoever, like me, is among the <strong>unlucky owners</strong> of a <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> console, probably knows well how the <strong>official dock</strong> is not only <strong>uncomfortable</strong>, but almost a joke in essence, something that almost <strong>shouldn't have existed</strong>!</p>



<h2>Here's what we're talking about</h2>

<p>The <strong>dock</strong>, for those who have been blissfully ignorant until now, is simply a <strong>proprietary base</strong> that provides some <strong>expansions</strong> to the console, including only one with minimal importance: the <strong>video output</strong>.</p>

<p>To avoid creating confusion, or assigning blame where it may not be due, let me clarify: all <strong>this article</strong> revolves around the <strong>first edition of the dock</strong>. In fact, Nintendo created an improved version when it released the OLED revision of the console in 2021. I <strong>only own the first model</strong> (as I only have the first edition of the Switch), so my experience is limited to that. Oh well, even if it seems that <strong>some minor problems</strong> have been <strong>resolved</strong>, overall the dock <strong>still remains sub-optimal</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Switch-Dock/Dock-Binned.webp" alt="My dock sitting in a trash bin... disassembled, because I've already built the subject of the next post."> <small><em>Here is the place where the dock should be: in the trash.</em></small></p>

<h2>For what began the end</h2>

<p>It's been since the proverbial <strong><em>day-one</em></strong>, that day in <strong>2017</strong> when Nintendo released this <strong>yet another console</strong> strong> on the market, which among the various <strong>criticisms</strong> that have arisen around it, many have also concerned its <strong>relationship with the dock</strong>.</p>

<h3>Video output made ugly</h3>

<p>The biggest <strong>annoyance</strong>, in my opinion, is due to the fact that the <strong>damned</strong> dock is the <strong>only way to have video output</strong> from the console to an external display. We all understand not wanting to put an HDMI port on the tablet, i.e. the actual console, but <strong>why necessarily</strong> require the dock?</p>

<p>Already <strong>3 years before</strong> the release of the Switch on the market, i.e. from <strong>2014</strong>, the "<em>standard" was widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#USB-C" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C Connector</a></ em>", the one currently <strong>implemented in all those portable PC</strong>s that do not include an HDMI port, and which precisely allows you to transport, on a <strong>single connector</strong>: sufficient energy to charging, <strong>video data, and data of all types</strong> (USB).<br>
If you then want to have extra USB ports, or directly an HDMI port (to connect to non-DisplayPort monitors), there are <strong>hubs on the market for less than a few dozen euros</strong> that are right for this case .<br>
Obviously, since Nintendo wanted to implement its <strong>questionable proprietary solution</strong>, <strong>connecting Switch directly</strong> to a monitor equipped with a USB-C port, or to one of these adapters, will not result in < strong>no video signal</strong> be transmitted.</p>

<p>Nintendo then <em>made sure</em> not to include <strong>wireless video transmission</strong> functions, not even as a secondary option, even if <em>homebrew</em> programs like <a href="https://github.com/exelix11/SysDVR" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SysDVR</a> demonstrate that the <strong>hardware is perfectly capable</strong> of a broadcast video via WLAN.<br>
For another thing, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracast" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Miracast</a> standard has been around since <strong>2012 </strong>, so there was plenty of time to implement it in the console, <strong>if only the parent company wanted</strong>. To tell the truth, since it is something <strong>implementable via software</strong> (the only hardware requirement is <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>), Nintendo has <strong>never had a deadline </strong> to include such a function, yet no firmware update released in these <strong>6 years</strong> has yet filled this <strong>gap</strong> (or various others); something that does nothing but confirm the <strong>laziness of the company</strong>.</p>

<h3>A blow to the wallet!</h3>

<p>Despite this <strong>Nintendo fixation</strong> with <strong>not implementing widespread standards</strong> — or, even worse, with doing it <strong>incorrectly</strong>, reinterpreting them and <strong>breaking them</strong> (I don't dare open my mouth about Switch issues that go beyond the base...) - at least <strong>the dock is included in the package</strong> of the console, and does not have to be purchased separately... something that I don't know whether to see as <strong>good or bad</strong>, considering that, costing <strong>80 euros</strong> if purchased separately, I imagine that its inclusion in the tablet box < strong>heavily impacts</strong> what would otherwise be the <strong>cost of the console</strong> alone.</p>

<p>If it is also true, however, that critics arrive even where someone offers a perfect product, <strong>this <em>plasticume</em></strong> accessory <strong>deserves</strong> all its <strong>bad reputation</strong>. I mean: all <strong>of us gamers</strong> would have expected something <strong>a moment better</strong>, with that <strong>bounty of €80</strong>, and therefore it must be said that <strong> >the negative aspects</strong> of this ornament honestly weigh much more <strong>than the positive sides</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ban the doors</h3>

<p>First of all, I find it a little <strong>ridiculous</strong> - <strong>albeit realistically <strong>insignificant</strong>, considering what competing consoles and other electronic devices in general offered in 2017 — that the dock provides <strong>only one</strong> digital audio-video output port (HDMI), and <strong>no analog</strong>.<br>
I repeat, it is not an intelligent excuse to go to Nintendo with pitchforks in hand, but it is at least <strong>disappointing</strong>, considering that <strong>the previous home console</strong> of the great N, the much-maligned <strong> >Wii U</strong>, had both releases.</p>

<p>A <strong>lack of input/output</strong> considered a problem by far more than 4 cats, however, concerns the <strong>Ethernet port</strong>. In specific areas, Wi-Fi has never really replaced wired network connections, and <strong>gaming</strong> is one of these.<br>
On Switch then, with the <strong>Wi-Fi drivers</strong> of Horizon OS (Nintendo's operating system), which is to say <strong>disgusting</strong> is a compliment, and with the <strong>lack support</strong> for <strong>USB tethering</strong> drivers (those that allow you to use, for example, an Android smartphone as a wired router), the <strong>only way</strong> to have a connection < strong>Quality Internet</strong> is buying an <strong>Ethernet-USB adapter</strong> (at least this one, fortunately, can be generic).</p>

<p>Yet, in this case, the <strong>lack of space is not a digestible excuse</strong> for not having included plenty of ports... the dock <strong>inside</strong> is <strong> >mostly empty space</strong>, rather than electronic components, and I think it would have been possible to do more (the OLED dock, in fact, at least has an Ethernet port).<br>
By the way: in itself, the <strong>lot of ABS plastic</strong> wouldn't be a problem — on the contrary, it gives <strong>good solidity</strong> and a <strong>weight compared to the product</strong> , which otherwise might tend to fly off tables and desks with little effort, and would perhaps be a little fragile. </p>

<p>Due to this, however, the dock <strong>is not at all easy to transport</strong>, mainly because it is <strong>too large</strong>.<br>
The <strong>weight</strong>, frankly speaking, <strong>is not a problem</strong> in this regard: the console alone with the <em>Joy-Con</em> (the side controllers) equipped it already weighs more than the dock alone... all that lithium in a plastic tablet, trust me, it <em>looks like lead</em>.<br>
The <strong>dimensions</strong>, however, if apparently small (at least compared to an entire fixed-only console) are <strong>problematic</strong> if <strong>you want to bring the dock</strong> in a bag or backpack together with the console. All <strong>transportable cases</strong>, obviously, <strong>cannot reserve</strong> a space for the base, unless they are as large as briefcases.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment with words in the wind, and <strong>talking about numbers</strong>, we are at 238x98x13 millimeters for the console (Joy-Con included), and 172x102x50 mm for the dock: in short, the latter it is <strong>almost 4 times as thick as the tablet</strong>, which is a <strong>problem</strong>.<br>
My generic briefcase case (one of those quasi-padded ones, with space for accessories) is, when closed, 249x126x52 millimeters: if it also included space for the dock it would be a duffel bag!</p>

<h2>Beyond banal appearances</h2>

<p>And it is exactly like this, by carefully observing <strong>ever more minute details</strong> in order to produce <strong>refined deductions</strong>, that we remember something - at least, I and all those who learn do- yourself and programming from my blog (much wrong?): <strong>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">over - engineering</a> is a danger</strong> always around the corner, when you try to do something particular.</p>

<h3>Clawed walls included!</h3>

<p>One of the <strong>design oversights</strong> that immediately emerged with the design of the base, and which would not have been present at all if only Nintendo had opted for a more essential design, is that <strong>the space in where the Switch</strong>tablet fits and rests is a little too tight. The two plastic faces are not so close that it feels strange when inserting or disconnecting the console, yet close enough to <strong>create scratches on the front</strong> of the console.<br>
To be fair, no scratches can accumulate in the actual area of the display, but realistically only <strong>at its edges</strong> (and on the <strong>most extreme pixels</strong> of the display, and here's where it comes from collective anger), given that it is only in that area that the dock has 2 symmetrical protrusions, which act as guides for insertion.</p>

<p>Obviously, the front panel <strong>gets scratched</strong> only because it <strong>is made of plastic</strong>: if it had been made of glass, no accidents would have occurred. However, considering the breadth of the market target to which the console is aimed, and the rest of its technical characteristics, a glass display would actually have been <strong>inadequate</strong>. After all, anyone who cares can, as I did, buy <strong>glass film</strong> for a few euros, and apply it in an instant.</p>

<h3>Reduced air flow</h3>

<p>Many games that run on Switch, in attempting to maintain an acceptable <strong>performance regime</strong> during the gameplay session, work <strong>to the detriment of temperatures</strong>, which <strong>rise by a lot</strong> (especially on the very first revision of the console, which features a more energy-intensive chip.<sup id="fnref1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1">1</a> </sup>). Hence the need for the console to have an <strong>active cooling system</strong>, which sucks air from a small grill on the back, and then spits it back (hot) at the top.</p>

<p>Not that I have much experience in fluid physics, but it seems to me, from the <strong>simple use</strong> of the console, that <strong>in dock the fans</strong> tend on average to <strong> always spin with <strong>more force</strong> than in portable mode, even with the same video resolution (720p) and, as a rule, CPU and GPU frequencies.<br>
In fact, due to the way the tablet rests in its base, half of the rear <strong>grill</strong> faces the dock cable compartment, while the other half is directly <strong>obstructed</strong> (very close to a wall plastic). This first half, in addition to possibly being partially obstructed by power and video cables, receives air only from the two small open spaces (on the left and top) on the back of the dock; and to me, <strong>this air seems little</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Switch-Dock/Air-Flow-Diagram-Dock.webp" alt="Model hand-drawn on paper, with colored markers."> Here is a graphic model of <strong>holes, air flows, and possible cables</strong>. The situation with the small <strong>rear grill</strong> is ugly (in blue, and out of scale due to excess, now that I notice)! <small>(Don't notice the fact that I reversed the USB-C port with the HDMI one...)</small></p>



<h3>Turn it horizontally?</h3>

<p>Finally, the <strong>lack of</strong> a <strong>horizontal positioning mode for the base</strong> is a bit stressful, which would be particularly <strong>useful when space is limited< /strong> and the cables must be short — as in gaming stations <strong>near the TV</strong> (a common situation in some Japanese homes, by the way), or even <strong>desk stations</strong> > (my case).<br>
If turned on its long side, in reality, the base remains there, and the console remains connected; but <strong>just pull</strong> something a little <strong>to make it slide</strong> out, and then disconnect.<br>
For the record, both Wii and Wii U, as well as the <strong>competition consoles</strong> (the present ones, and several past ones), were designed to be able to <strong>rest in both</strong> orientations. </p>

<p>It would have been convenient to have this option, although perhaps <strong>it's not the end</strong> of the world, compared to the other hassles: also because all you need to do is add a <strong>self-made triangular support</strong> ( or bought from sellers who deal with <em>plastic craftsmanship</em>) to have a more decent situation, in which the console remains <strong>a little inclined</strong> with respect to the support surface of the base ( and not almost parallel).</p>

<h2>What to do</h2>

<p>What can be done then if this <em>plasticone</em> is the cause of all these <strong>serious diseases</strong>? We said it above: using a <strong>generic USB hub</strong>, as on all normal devices, is <strong>not possible</strong> here.</p>

<h3>Dock that <em>the great uncle bought</em> at the market...</h3>

<p>Mostly only on the Web, there are <strong>third-party Switch docks</strong> for sale, in all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, following the <strong>negative reports</strong> made by many users after a variable time of use, I do not consider them <strong>reliable at all</strong> (even if certainly some of the hundreds will be, but who knows which ones!).<br>
Due to the <strong>bizarre protocol</strong> according to which the <strong>energy</strong> is managed between Nintendo Switch and its official accessories, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news /nintendo-switch-brick-docks" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">it seems that the console can break with third-party accessories</a> that (also) provide charging. Which is bizarre, so to speak, because virtually <strong>any other device</strong> on the market with a USB charging port <strong>does not break</strong>, except with unorthodox and deliberate procedures, which beyond using a competitor's charger.</p>

<p>On Amazon in particular, however, you can also find other types, <strong>in addition to the clones</strong> made from scratch of the dock:</p>

<ul>
<li>The compact ones that <strong>contain</strong> - or at least, so they say, but it seems so looking at the photos (the layout of the ports and the dimensions of the card, by eye, match) - <strong>the official card</strong> contained in the base produced by Nintendo (such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230630114837/https://www.amazon.it/Docking-station-portatile-replacement -official/dp/B0C49WC9BQ" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this one for €24.99</a>).</li>
<li>The same thing just presented, same design, same dimensions, but <strong>without any integrated card</strong> (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230630135554/https: //www.amazon.it/eXtremeRate-AiryDocky-Nintendo-Portatile-OLED-Trasparente/dp/B0BW3YX946" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this one for €19.99</a>): they are < strong>do-it-yourself kit</strong>, the idea is to <strong>take the card</strong> from the dock you already have and mount it in this <strong>new body</strong>.</strong> li>
</ul>

<h4>...<em>and that was how his money burned</em>.</h4>

<p>Whatever option you choose, it seems that you end up paying <strong>at least 20 hard euros</strong> just for <strong>bad plastic</strong>, screws, springs, and some <strong>other nonsense< /strong>. Even this, in terms of price, is simply excessive to say the least; it's too much, period. <strong>Everything is overcharged</strong>, and I bet that if one of the Chinese housewives in my shop sold at least one DIY kit, it would hardly cost more than 10 euros.</p>

<h3>Only one option</h3>

<p>At the end of everything, then, <strong>I only have one option left</strong>: plastic, cardboard, glue, tape, pins, and elastics. This time too <strong>it's time for the do-it-yourself piece</strong>, the one at <strong>totally zero cost</strong> <a href="https://sitoctt.octt.eu.org/Categories /DIY.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">which I really like</a>.<br>
There's way too much to talk about, as usual, so that'll all be for the next article! <small>I hope I haven't bored anyone to death today, otherwise who will ever be able to read the second part...</small></p>
