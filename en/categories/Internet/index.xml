      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;This year, my most assiduous followers know, I enjoy the privilege of not having to take the final exam: I already gave enough last year, while now I find myself in the much worse vortex of university. But, for those who don&#39;t give my online profiles the necessary attention: it&#39;s okay, you&#39;ve discovered it now.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Some will know, in Italy the new anti-piracy law has been approved, and now the doubts with which we enthusiasts of sharing free we have to deal with are different:&#xA;When will it come into force? (I hope not exactly at the time I&#39;m writing this post üò∞) How much money will the entertainment lobbies have spent to ensure that the law was passed with total unanimity?</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;By now, we know, the more time passes, the more I end up exploring ever more minute details of the Fediverse.&#xA;Today I&#39;ll tell you a little about a platform of this world that is quite unknown, and which had good premises, but turned out to be a hole in the water: Epicyon strong&gt;.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;This article can probably be considered as the first of a series on the site philosophy, if you want to say so.&#xA;To start, what is better to talk about, if not everything that led to the birth of the site and began to characterize it?&#xA;When, 3 months ago now, I had just started to conceive the ctt site, one of the things I felt was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a place in which to arrange my stuff - the stuff to be preserved and shared publicly, at least - in a way that made it tidy, available, watchable, usable, and loss-proof.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Today&amp;rsquo;s Web is unquestionably very different from that of 20 years ago, and it changes more and more with each passing year.&#xA;Looking at the positive sides of progress is always very easy and reassuring, and for this reason we rarely think about the dark sides which, in many, many things, exist.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;In recent days I have settled the first matters regarding making the site available on the Tor network. There are those who will call me exaggerated for even having the thought of doing something like this, but there is little that can be done.&#xA;If nothing has gone wrong, the Onion service can still be reached at this address: onmfrk2acl4xdeawfjg3nfepq7gcufolctmhiwwxpcknazus5bxzxhqd.</description>
