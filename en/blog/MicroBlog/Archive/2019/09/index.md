>: Except that he's already kind of bent, because he got hit so many times because he was a meme

> : But Lagsoong can have just 1 KB free and doesn't break with Chinese popups

A bit of context is in order here: this crap smartphone, when it only has ~100 MB free on its internal memory, pops up this popup about every 3 minutes, which is annoying to say the least. And believe me, it is easy to fill the memory of a smartphone with Android 7 which, after taking out the space occupied by the system components, only has 7.5 GB of space available to the user.

> : And so, nothing, since I have sawdust in my brain, for literally almost a year I thought it was my corrupt ROM, because even if I reflashed it always gave an error at the end, and for literally a year I wasted time looking for other ROM to no avail

>: Oh and, obviously I tried to connect to Kies simply, but it didn't recognize the phone, it kept charging, and if I went into Kies' manual recovery mode it asked me for a code (?)

> : Then just the day before yesterday the good Ashflee told me that all I needed was the right PIT file and it would be fixed  
> : I didn't know because I'm laggy

> : So today I find the PIT file of the US version and I don't care about the fact that I have the European Galaxy, I put PIT and flash the US ROM and  
> : E  
> : It's in bootloop because well, there was sawdust in /data and it wouldn't mount

> : I format /data from recovery and the lag comes on, and now it works and is better than my meme

#### [2019-09-16 18:14] The beginning of OctoVoLTE </summary>
> : So, there will be Lagsung stuff on this channel

> ![VoLTE]({{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Misc/phh-VoLTE-JiOwO.avif)

The history of OctoVoLTE officially began from these messages. Memewei has been talked about there in recent years, perhaps too much; Of methods to have VoLTE, there hasn't been even one, like. Sad.
