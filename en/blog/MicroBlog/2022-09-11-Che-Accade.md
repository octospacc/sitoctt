These last 7 days, very little has been said or done here on the ctt site.  
I created this section to use as a general journal, but I'm just now writing something.

First of all, school started again the day before yesterday for me.  
It's still too early for it to steal my time in the afternoon, but in the morning the story is a bit what it is. Just as the mess when you start again is always the same, with the timetables being messed up and in general still having holidays on your mind.  
Due to these factors, I have a little less time in total to do little things.

Let's add that, due to a curious need of mine, in the last few days I have had to start programming [yet another new tool](https://gitlab.com/octospacc/links)... I won't start babbling about the thing itself, because this section is for everything except my development adventures, but the travails can be told: I started developing on Thursday, and I only had a minimal working tool last night.  
All this, because I wanted to exaggerate with the idea (as usual), and because every afternoon from Thursday to Sunday, until early evening, I was [at the fair](./PicoBlog.html#-2022-09-11 -La-fiera) and, returning home tired, the desire to plan was low.

To this mix we add another distraction: after 5 years, a new chapter of the Splatoon saga has been released, and therefore there is little to do, you have to play. However, after a brief analysis, I am trying not to play with it too much, to try to sip it as much as possible so as not to consume it immediately.  
Today I didn't play it at all, for example, and I think I'll end the evening without it; but maybe it's because today I had experiments to do regarding dumping digital school books, to have them without DRM.  
By the way, when I finish the story and have tried even a minimal amount of multiplayer, I will publish a review of the game, which I'm already writing along the way.

At the beginning I tried to put the game on a PC emulator, but between glitches (which will soon be resolved), a bit of lag, and the inability to play decently away from the desktop, I had to try on real hardware.  
My Switch console, however, had been working as a server for 7 months now. Enough, Spoon is vital: I'm putting the Raspino back out.

I haven't put all my software back yet, but the important ones (SpaccCraft and my bots) are there. I also added a new little thing, qbittorrent, which takes care of seeding some torrents even when my PC is turned off.  
I also need to tidy up some things regarding backups, for some of my bots, it takes a while.
