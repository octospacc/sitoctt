      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;I believe Minecraft can be defined as the modern game (for better or worse) that develops potentially infinite complexity from simple premises. In a good way, obviously: complexity impresses and rewards those who seek it, but the title remains playable for anyone.&#xA;At first it&amp;rsquo;s making &amp;ldquo;houses&amp;rdquo; that are 4x4 holes under the ground, but later it becomes creating titanic installations, purely aesthetic or even totally functional - let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that Minecraft, with its redstone, is Turing-complete.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;From YouTube/2N1TJP1cxmo.&#xA;The best way to describe Mirror&amp;rsquo;s Edge is to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a game in constant motion. Literally standing on the edge of the mirror, the edges of the enormous glass of which the buildings of La Citt√† are made, one runs and jumps without any brakes.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;In Minesweeper (in Italian officially &amp;ldquo;Minefield&amp;rdquo;) you have a game grid in which bombs have been randomly placed (by an algorithm). To win, you need to locate them all without exploding any of them.&#xA;The rules are simple, but the game easily reaches high levels of complexity and has an I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-what that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;2048 is a simple puzzle game in which you have a grid of randomly generated numbered tiles that you can slide entirely in one of four directions. All numbers are powers of 2, and equal numbers that collide add to become their double.&#xA;If you reach 2048 by adding up the tiles, you win a game, which however can go on even further.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Pilotwings Resort Pilotwings Resort continues the Pilotwings arcade flight simulation series in a different way. It ends up on a portable console, the 3DS, among other things a console that manages to grab you directly, with its stereoscopic 3D display. The game is set on Wuhu Island, the same place full of history, locations, and mysteries as Wii Sports Resort.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;The premises were creative, but boring: you are a human being who, for some reason, goes on a journey to settle in a village where humanoid animals live with whom you can interact. In the meantime, you have to get into debt with a raccoon who sells you the new house at a very high price, and do what you can to repay, with times that can become infinite.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Lively and frenetic 3D platformer, undoubtedly coming from the Super Mario 64 school. The difficulty of the main story is right, and the game flows pleasantly with an alternation of themes and environments that always feels fresh.&#xA;But, in short, the charisma of the protagonist character alone makes you want to play.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Third person shooter which to say is different from the others is an understatement. Splatoon breaks the genre&amp;rsquo;s expectations of war realism, and features cute, dazzlingly colorful gameplay that never lets up. There are no humans shooting bullets with iron, but squids spilling ink.&#xA;Playing in Mollusc Melee (this is the name of the 4-on-4 online battles) is fun, but the depth of the game and the inventiveness of the development team can be seen in story mode.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Celeste is a nice little platformer game, with original mechanics and a unique graphic style. But it&amp;rsquo;s too difficult.&#xA;I tried to play it many times, but at a certain point in the story the difficulty became too high for me. I should maybe try finishing it in guided mode, since the option is there.</description>
