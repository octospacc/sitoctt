Lively and frenetic 3D platformer, undoubtedly coming from the Super Mario 64 school. The difficulty of the main story is right, and the game flows pleasantly with an alternation of themes and environments that always feels fresh.  
But, in short, the charisma of the protagonist character alone makes you want to play.
