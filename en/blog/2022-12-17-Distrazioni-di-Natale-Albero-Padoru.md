<p>Ahhh, and here we are in November again this year. I would say that it is time to start the necessary procedure of <em>thawing the <strong>Padoru</strong></em>.<br>
...No, wait a minute. IT'S ALREADY <strong>MID DECEMBER?!?!?!</strong> üòê üò∂ ü§Ø<br>
The months pass quickly... <em>oh well</em>.</p>



<h2>What is "Padoru"</h2>

<p>For many a <strong>controversial issue</strong> and a <strong>despised custom</strong>, that of the <strong>Padoru</strong>.<br>
For those 3 people who live under the stones <em>(and who I don't know how they could be reading this blog now, but I'll ignore it)</em>: it's a <strong>meme</strong> which, according to < a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/padoru" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Know Your Meme</a>, born from a video game, <em>Fate/EXTRA</em >.<br>
In a <a href="https://youtu.be/efdN69QscAg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">game scene</a>, <a href="https://typemoon.fandom. com/it/wiki/Nero" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (I'm not joking)</a> wears a <strong>Santa Claus</strong> costume, and dances in I walk around what I think is a corridor, singing an original <strong>parody</strong> of <em>Jingle Bells</em>, just 4 verses long.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HASHIRE SORI YO<br>
KAZE NO YOU NI<br>
TSUKIMIHARA WO<br>
PADORU PADORU</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to look up the meaning of the little song, but <a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/43895/what-does-padoru-padoru-mean" rel="noopener nofollow" target= "_blank">I did not have satisfactory results</a>.<br>
The only thing I know is that the <strong>last verse</strong> (from which the popular name of the meme derives), "<em>padoru padoru</em>", is the <strong>Japanese equivalent</strong> of the Italian "<em>cloppete cloppete</em>", the <strong>onomatopoeia</strong> of the sound of the <strong>reindeer's hooves</strong>. I don't know how this is possible but, honestly, it's the least strange detail.</p>

<h2>Internet customs</h2>

<p><strong>Online</strong>, various <strong>traditions</strong> have developed around this meme for several years.<br>
The most banal are the excessive <strong>re-sharing</strong> of the original <strong>video</strong> or its GIF images, or the production and sharing of original <strong>memes</strong> that refer to the initial concept.<br>
Then, people began to deprecate the expression "Christmas season", in favor of a more magical "<strong><em>Padoru season</em></strong>" - which is not really a replacement term 1:1, because it can also indicate the weeks a moment before perhaps those of Advent, those of November that I mentioned at the beginning and in which we are already starting with the <strong>Padoru guerrilla war</strong> on the communication platforms. </p>

<p>The most beautiful custom (due to its passive-aggressiveness), according to my tastes, is to change the photos of one's various profiles with the image of <strong>a Padoru</strong>.<br>
There are people who use their shared sense of humor to implement this thing as a (very relatively) mass operation. Then there are those who observe the phenomenon but are not aware of the meaning, do not understand, get angry, and are confused to the point of hitting themselves; or, who knows him perfectly, and gets even more angry because, well, <em>maybe he despises Christmas</em>.</p>

<p>If you are reading <strong>carefully</strong>, you will have noticed that I have just used, not surprisingly, the indefinite article... <small>If you haven't noticed, you are getting distracted, and therefore , <del>as punishment</del> for your good, now I must necessarily force you to sing the above song out loud 3 times üë∫.</small></p>

<h2>High customization</h2>

<p>An <strong>important factor</strong> that has allowed this meme to become the phenomenon it is can be seen in its being <strong>extremely customizable</strong>.<br>
I don't know when this trend started, but at a certain point there were those who saw that the Padoru, Nero's original drawing in the video sequence that sparked it all, it's really <strong>simple to remix</strong>.</p>

<p>If you look at it with absent or at least down-to-earth inventiveness, you realize that you can <strong>change the colors</strong> in the blink of an eye with others that can equally look good, and It almost has a new design.<br>
However, those who have a minimum of creativity can without difficulty try to modify some of the shapes of the character, changing the right here and there to reconstruct a totally different <strong>character</strong> - whether original, or already existing but only drawn with other styles - in the form of that smiling little thing who runs around breaking up with his festive verse. </p>

<p>This stuff is so extremely easy that <strong>even I</strong>, who normally if I try to draw anything artistic (or at least not very technical) create real <em>glitches</em> >, <strong>I was able to create my</strong> very personal Padoru without any suffering.<br>
In just 2 very scant hours, one morning on December 1st at school - I don't remember if it was a day of assembly or of various substitutes - a little <strong>tracing</strong> the basic lines of the Padoru aspect, a little <strong>introducing original features</strong> (which I derived from my 3D character, the one that appears in some of my profile photos throughout the year), with a generic drawing app on my smartphone I did what I felt I had to do .<br>
The result was that, simply, something normal emerged; no horror! Very good. </p>

In the first I had finished the outlines and was starting to color the hair purple. In the second I had completed the work and sent the PNG file."></ a></p>

<h2>My "participations"</h2>

<p>Last year I <strong>created</strong> my Padoru specifically to use it as a <strong>profile photo</strong> (on Telegram), and I did.<br>
The year before I had used one that wasn't mine, modeled on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221217073124/https://teddit.net/r/Padoru/comments/czxoa7/senko_san_at_your_service" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">kitsune Senko-san</a>, and the previous year I had posted other types of Padoru memes.</p>

<p><strong>This year</strong> I haven't done a whole lot of <strong>anything</strong>... and the peculiar thing is that I don't know how to explain it. Zero. üò∂<br>
What I suspect is that, simply, <strong>I forget üíÄ</strong> (<em>I forgot about it üíÄ</em>). 2 weeks ago I unfortunately had <strong>too many things on my mind</strong>: first my Misskey instance malfunctions and I have to run, then the fixation with ChatGPT, it's clear that there was really no way to reserve 30 seconds of time to update the photo of not even a single one of my online accounts.<br>
At this point, I don't know whether to make the <strong>change</strong> now and therefore take advantage of all the time remaining until the end of the Christmas period to be <em>Padoruante</em>, or follow a minimal logic and wait the beginning of next week: the last week of Advent and the first of the holidays, it would make sense.</p>

<p>Last year I may have gone all out with digital photos, but <strong>the physical side</strong> was accidentally <strong>neglected</strong> by me.<br>
Let's go in order.</p>

<p>All my parents actually put up the generic Christmas decorations <strong>at home</strong> - <strong>my mother</strong> in particular, who also has <strong>power to veto</strong>on any overly progressive proposals regarding the large Christmas tree - in the first days of December.<br>
Among the things that are taken back from the attic every year, there is also a small <strong>desk tree</strong> which is <em>practically</em> mine. It has <strong>integrated lights</strong>, powered by AA batteries, but in itself it is nothing too special. Or rather, that's how it was before I <strong>revolutionized</strong> it, <strong>3 years ago</strong> (it was 2019!).</p>

<h2>Modify the tree</h2>

<p>I think the <strong>flash of genius</strong> came after seeing a photo on the <strong>Internet</strong>, which depicted a <strong>Christmas tree</strong> (of normal size) with <strong>attached</strong> to a pair of <strong>paper pads</strong>; exactly like other types of decorations that hang, but less socially acceptable.<br>
The idea had now taken possession of me, and at this point I had to recreate the same thing myself. I opened what was my trusted web <strong>search engine</strong> at the time, and searched for "<code class="prettyprint">padorus images</code>" (or something like that), to create an <strong>assorted set</strong> of some of those little drawings, <strong>downloading</strong> the ones that caught my attention and <strong>I liked</strong> aesthetically the most.</p>

<p>At that moment I had a <strong>choice</strong> in front of me: do I print them big enough and put them on the <strong>big tree</strong>, or do I print them small to be able to put them on the <strong>tree? little tree</strong>?<br>
To be honest, it <strong>wasn't a question</strong> of choice, as the first option was automatically to be thrown away due to my mother's <strong>veto</strong>, but the second option certainly intrigued me: the The little tree was (and is) in <strong>my room</strong>, so its normality would be completely wasted without some creative embellishment.</p>

<p>Once the <strong>print</strong> was done, all that remained for me was to <strong>cut</strong> out, more or less roughly (nevertheless, a good amount of work was strangely needed), the various Padoru, to then <strong>attach them</strong> to the tree with a little hot glue.<br>
It turned out <strong>what I wanted</strong>, so I appreciated the work and took a photo to set it as my profile picture. The following year, the tree <strong>remained as it was</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Padoru/Padoru-Tree-2019-2022.avif" alt="The mini-tree as it was until the other day, before I did that that I have done now. There are less than ten Padoru"></p>





<h2>In the present</h2>

<p>As regards <strong>this year</strong>, once I finally mentally entered the <em>Padorizia atmosphere</em>, <strong>contemplating</strong> that object that has been there for days on my <strong>bedside table</strong>, I thought it was a bit <strong>empty</strong>, and needed <strong>other Padoru</strong>.</p>

<p>The other day <strong>I thought</strong> that I should then <strong>look</strong> for some <strong>new</strong> ones online to print them, but a moment later it comes back to me <strong> a folder</strong>, which I found last month on my PC while I was cleaning.<br>
It contains <strong>my original Padoru</strong>, <strong>and various others</strong> that I remembered having downloaded, but that I wasn't too <strong>sure I had</strong> > never <strong>printed</strong>. The files are all dated December 2021, which is obvious for the only one I created, but actually curious for the others, if you consider the whole scenario.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Padoru/Padoru-Folder-2021.png" alt="Some of the individual Padoru images in the folder; 23 in total. Note that they are dated all '8 December 2022."></p>

<p>Even more curiously, one of the files present there is an image, with an aspect ratio equal to that of an A4 sheet, where all the individual images in the folder are arranged.<sup id="fnref1">< a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><br>
"<em>I will have composed it last year and in the end perhaps I will never have printed it again</em>", I think; and yet, something else in my mind tells me that <strong>I actually printed it</strong> all right, and maybe I simply <strong>never used</strong> it in the end. Surely, I have never attached those Padoru to the tree, because there are only those from 3 years ago.<br>
For less than a quarter of an hour I searched for this unfortunate <strong>sheet</strong> in my room but, not finding it, <strong>I decided to reprint it</strong>. Oh God, I actually found a paper by Padoru... more or less: I found a fragment of the paper from 2019, with 3 images that I never used at the time.</p>

<p>Without wasting any more time, I send the document to the <strong>home printer</strong>, which promptly <strong>gives me back</strong>... a <strong>blank sheet of paper</strong>? It looked like it, but then I picked it up and noticed that it had been printed. The image? <strong>NO! A STAIN! ü§¨</strong><br>
Immediately, <strong>anger</strong> takes over, but a second later it is <strong>overcome</strong> by an even stronger sensation: one of "already seen</strong>".</strong> p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Padoru/Padoru-Failed-Print.jpg" alt="Photo of the poorly printed sheet. In place of some Padoru there are color spots, for others you can only see the outlines, for others still nothing."></p>

<h3>...A little earlier</h3>

<p>At this point, <strong>something</strong> comes back to me</strong>, and I open the history of my Telegram channel (which I use as a micro-microblog) to look for answers to my suspicions : well, <strong>I printed</strong> these images <strong>last year</strong>. Now I remembered well!<br>
<strong>The exact same <strong>problem</strong> had happened with the print going to hell which, strangely, occurs on 2 different printers, only by sending to print via the official application of <strong>Epson</strong> (printer manufacturer) for Android, and only for this image (PNG 2480x3472 of 9 MB), among all the ones I have had to print in my life.<br>
For the first time I wasted time with my father - who had previously used the printer without any particular problems - first changing a cartridge marked empty, then cleaning the heads; after I don't know how many wasted minutes, on the <strong>third</strong> attempt to print I did it from my father's Windows PC, and the image <strong>finally</strong> came out. üò∂u200düå´Ô∏èüî™</p>

<p>This time however, as soon as I connected all the dots for a moment, I immediately tried again from the PC...<br>
Is it seriously too much to expect the official app to work as it should, or at least give an error, which it never gave me, if for some reason it can't handle a file correctly? I should send <strong>to hell</strong> once and for all these rotten, smelly <strong>proprietary printers</strong> straight out of hell, and build my own: with a microcontroller, servomotors, and of markers, as wiser people have already <a href="https://youtu.be/AlBPFC41FsM" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">have done</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, my intention, that distant day, was to <strong>troll</strong><sup id="fnref2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn2">2</ a></sup> <strong>my mother</strong>: print some new Padoru, all different and <strong>coloured</strong>, to <strong>attach</strong> them to the large Christmas tree, which that year it had been decorated by her with decorations categorically <strong>tending towards white</strong>.<br>
In short, I printed all those there, but I only put <strong>1</strong> in number on the tree (among other things, it seems like 2 days passed before my mother noticed üòÇ), so it's clear that < strong>I planned</strong>to do something <strong>with those others</strong>. I probably would have liked to <strong>put</strong> them on the <strong>mini-tree</strong>, but (yet, evidently) I <strong>never</strong> did it. <em>Did I forger (üíÄ)?</em> Very likely: these last December were also somewhat busy weeks, but I made January arrive (time to refreeze Christmas and all the decorations, Padoru and otherwise) without do nothing, then the thing will have just slipped my mind.</p>

<h2>Concrete conclusion</h2>

<p>Between <strong>yesterday and the day before yesterday</strong>, I first <strong>cut out</strong> a good part of <strong>the Padoru</strong>; not all of them, because otherwise I really spend hours on them, and because there won't be any left on my desk tree. ü§∑u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è<br>
This time I used the scissors in a truly painstaking manner, and I <strong>outlined the figures</strong> with a very high <strong>definition</strong>; by my <em>shredding standards</em> of <em>drawings that have a lot of fine details of complex shapes</em>, at least, it is.<br>
After this task - which would also be relaxing, if I didn't have to <em>stare bend</em><sup id="fnref3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn3">3</a ></sup> because of the light - with the <strong>hot glue</strong> gun, little by little (which still requires much less time than cutting) <strong>I glued</strong> all the figurines to the external leaf walls of the <strong>tree</strong>. <strong>I took the</strong> advantage of it to <strong>fix</strong> the elements stuck together 3 years ago, which were holding up but not very solidly... I probably <strong>did the job badly</strong>, < strong>at the time</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Padoru/Padoru-Tree-New-0.webp" alt="Photo of the sapling after attacking"><br>
This here is the result, I really like it a lot.</p>

<p>Aside from the <strong>beauty of the object</strong> on a level that is <strong>personal</strong> for me, and having realized how it could - just in my eyes - become more beautiful, if it had become even <strong>newer</strong> and less standard, the high stakes of <strong>writing</strong> an article here <strong>worked miracles</strong>: it made me <strong> strong>complete</strong>a <strong>very simple</strong> manual activity, practically kindergarten-level do-it-yourself, without my brain canceling it after half a day !</p>

<p>To conclude, in essence we can - not ironically - say that <strong>it took an entire year</strong> for me to finally manage to <strong>attach</strong> a satisfactory quantity of small Padoru to my little tree.<br>
<strong>The day before yesterday</strong> I started <strong>writing</strong> this article, <strong>believing</strong> that I would simply talk about how the idea originated for me </strong> and what I did to expand it in these two days, but then I <strong>rediscovered</strong> these <strong>details</strong> which are directly <strong>intertwined</strong> with the < strong>last year</strong>... wonderful. I think the <strong>story</strong> actually became <strong>more interesting</strong> to tell, <strong>after these misadventures</strong> due to the questionable functioning of my brain.</p >

<p>On the channel I found the <strong><a href="https://imagemagick.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a></strong> command that I used to create the large image containing all the others arranged in a grid, I put it here for those who need to print things of this type: (to be done in the folder with all the images to be included) <code class="prettyprint">montage - define png:size=496x496 -geometry 496x496 -tile 5x7 -auto-orient * OUTPUT.png</code>. The values of "496x496" and "5x7" can be modified as desired, here they are placed so that the resulting file will have <strong>dimensions</strong> very close to those of <strong>A4</strong>, with <strong>35 maximum images on a single sheet, all <strong>equally</strong> scaled and <strong>squared</strong>.
