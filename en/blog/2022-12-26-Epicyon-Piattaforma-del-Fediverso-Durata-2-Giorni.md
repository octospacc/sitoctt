<p>By now, we know, the more time passes, the more I end up <strong>exploring</strong> ever more minute details of the <strong>Fediverse</strong>.<br>
Today I'll tell you a little about a <strong>platform</strong> of this world that is quite <strong>unknown</strong>, and which had good premises, but turned out to be a hole in the water: <strong>Epicyon</strong> strong>.<br>
Before starting, however, let's see what a <strong>desperate situation</strong> I ended up in.</p>



<p>5 weeks ago I had finally installed my instance of Misskey, to date a highly respectable <strong>microblogging</strong> platform in the <strong>ActivityPub</strong> panorama, which has been slowly gaining more and more in recent times users.<br>
One of the reasons why Misskey is growing is certainly that it is <strong>lighter</strong> than Mastodon, and this is also why I initially preferred its installation. Alas, fate <strong>still</strong> wanted to mistreat me, deciding to let everything end in a <strong>big fiasco</strong> (with a small tasting one first).<br>
Without going into too much detail - anyone who thinks they want to know can read my complaints about Mastodon in the days of <a href="https://mastodon.uno/@octo/109439207514394158" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank ">Thursday 1</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.uno/@octo/109508472717947364" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Tuesday 13</a> <small>(√® clearly not a coincidence...)</small> (but the good discussion started <a href="https://mastodon.uno/@octo/109518037875867744" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2 days after</a>) of this December, or wait for an article that <em>maybe</em> I will write - from the fateful day until December 19th I was again without an instance <em>my my mine</em >. Again <strong>without power</strong>, since my <strong>kingdom</strong> was reduced <strong>to ashes</strong>.</p>

<p>After this entire week, in which I tried and tried again to get my server back up and running, <strong>failing</strong> miserably, <strong>I clearly understood</strong> that it was <strong>needed</strong> > a reconfiguration from scratch, preferably with some <strong>lighter software</strong> than Misskey.<br>
It was at this point that I said to myself "yes, let's try this <strong>Epicyon</strong>; what could possibly go wrong?". Eh eh, what...</p>



<h2>A look at Epicyon</h2>

<p><a href="https://epicyon.net" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epicyon</a> I discovered it weeks ago, totally by chance, while I was looking for something, I don't remember what , on the Web.</p>

<p>That list of <strong>plus points</strong> that appears on the main page of the site immediately catches my attention: a technology stack that isn't flashy or used only because it's trendy, with <strong>little complexity</strong> strong> server side (and therefore requiring few resources there), even with <strong>zero client-side JavaScript</strong> (so the application weighs virtually nothing), suitable for installation on <a href="https: //it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">single-board computer</a>, also designed for <a href="https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_web_browser" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">browser with terminal interface</a>... the <strong>premises</strong> were <strong>good</strong> >.</p>

<p>The advantages of <strong>low-scale technology</strong> were immediately showcased by this little program: the installation amounted to installing some dependencies from apt, downloading the sources from the repository, and creating the configurations for the <em>reverse proxy</em> (Nginx) and the boot system (systemd).<br>
Absolutely zero problems along the way; <strong>the trouble</strong>, in fact, <strong>came later!</strong></p>

<p>I created my accounts - first the "<em>sysadmin</em>" one, which holds the administration permissions and which I use to write as an instance administrator, and then the personal one - as I begin to orient myself in the application, <strong>several minor problems</strong> become aware of my presence and, like spirits, one at a time <strong>begin to manifest</strong>.</p>

<h2>The user interface</h2>

<p>Let's start with the<strong>interface</strong>, which is the first thing you deal with when using any application; well, <strong>it's really strange</strong>!<br>
Once you learn it <strong>it's not difficult</strong>, <strong>but</strong> it has certain things that seem designed to cause <strong>confusion</strong>.</p>

<p>On your profile page you click the banner (which wastes space, I feel like saying, compared to a small button) at the top of the home page.<br>
Only from the profile page can you then open the <strong>settings</strong> of the account, which are <strong>mixed</strong> with those of instance administration without a clear division.<sup id="fnref1" ><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><br>
On the main screen <strong>not all subsections</strong> (including specific views for message flows) are <strong>visible</strong>, you need to click a button to show all the buttons.<br>
Questionable choices.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem to be the intent at all, but <strong>I like to think</strong> that this is a <strong>point in favor</strong>, because it performs an <strong>artificial selection</strong> of the users: those Twitter refugees, who months ago (now the situation has calmed down) arrived on Mastodon to behave badly - publishing public messages like "<em>ooo but how the fuck do you use this thing?</em>", or " <em>what a shitty social network, you don't understand shit</em>", and I won't report anything else - they won't seek refuge even by mistake from what is "more than a dog" (this is the etymology of the name of the platform, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicyon" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according to Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h3>Graphic customization</h3>

<p>One of the things I was looking for most in the settings was the <strong>theme</strong> configuration.<br>
Initially I only found the <strong>color customization</strong> and text size options of the applied theme, but luckily that wasn't all: it was a bit hidden, but in the end I found the <strong>option to switch to a completely different template</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, I didn't like the default theme very much, but I found <strong>some nice ones</strong> among those others already included. My <strong>favorite</strong> is called "<strong>Pixel</strong>", and offers a view that appears <strong>relaxing</strong> to me, with its backgrounds of a <strong>pseudo violet -lavender</strong> (<code class="prettyprint" style="Background: #9ba0d4; Color:#000000;">#9ba0d4</code>) and the text shown with a <strong>particular font</strong> >, with characters made up of small squares put together (indeed, to simulate clearly visible pixels). The effect it has is <strong>interesting</strong>, because it is evidently a theme that cannot be classified either as light or dark; exists in its category. Or perhaps it can be defined as light, because the text is black, then the background is necessarily light by contrast. Oh well, I don't care: the fundamental point is that, for me, it's <strong>really beautiful</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Theme-Designer-Pixel.png" alt="The theme customization tool ("Theme Designer"), seen with loaded the "Pixel" theme."></p>

<p>Another theme that caught my attention was "LCD", which simulates an old monochrome LCD screen with a <strong>greenish background</strong>. I <strong>appreciate</strong> it very much <strong>on an artistic level</strong>, but I just can't use it, it's <strong>too heavy</strong> on the eyes using a modern backlit screen!</p>

<p>It is a <strong>pity</strong> however, in my opinion, that the <strong>changes</strong> to the graphics are applied at instance level, and therefore <strong>reserved</strong> only < strong>to administrators</strong> (to those with the "Artist" rank, precisely). Other platforms, such as Friendica and Misskey, implement themes more flexibly.</p>

<h3>Scaling issues</h3>

<p>There are also themes that are more suitable for anyone, but unfortunately the graphics of the<strong>interface</strong> have an even more serious problem regarding what can fall under unsatisfiable aesthetic desires: <strong>scaling poorly</strong> strong>.<br>
Perhaps with some of the themes the problem is not too noticeable, but with others the <strong>text</strong> is often <strong>too large</strong>, and it happens several times that <strong>buttons or icons</strong> > are <strong>disproportionate</strong> or even misaligned.</p>

<p>Testing on an almost full screen (the screen space occupied by browser and operating system elements must therefore be taken into account), on a desktop PC with a 1360x768 monitor, and on a mobile with a 6.2" 9:18 display, I think that <strong I would like maybe a little less <strong>padding</strong>, even if all in all the interface is OK. The <strong>unusability</strong> comes when I try slightly more square resolutions, for example by keeping the browser window not completely expanded horizontally on my 16:9 monitor. In this case, I'll let the following video do the talking. Even on my smartphone, things can look ugly , if I turn it horizontally.</p>




<video title="Video showing scaling at different resolutions, and how it's too crooked at some, with the "Pixel" theme." class="Center" src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/UI-Scaling-Bug-Pixel.webm" controls="true" muted="true" loop="true" autoplay ="true">Video showing scaling at different resolutions, and how it's too crooked at some, with the "Pixel" theme.</video>

<h2>Getting to the heart of it</h2>

<p>I think it would be easy for me to fix the interface, since it would involve changing the CSS a bit and that's the end of the story.<br>
Before I could even think about it, unfortunately, other <strong>problems</strong> emerged, this time <strong>of functionality</strong>.</p>

<h3>Trying to publish...</h3>

<p><strong>The very first post</strong> I sent from the platform, made without touching any options other than the simple text field, <strong>seemed fine</strong>.</p>

<p>A moment later, as soon as I created the second account, <strong>I noticed</strong> an appreciable function - which Mastodon introduced only a few months ago, while other popular platforms do not feature at all: <strong>the choice of language </strong> used in your own post, used to allow other users to <strong>filter</strong> away public messages that appear in unwanted languages. I then <strong>set</strong> my new message <strong>in Italian</strong>, just to, I published... and the message <strong>did not appear</strong> to me in any timeline. Only on Epicyon, though, and from both of my accounts; on other instances it appeared normally.<br>
It took me a good 10 minutes to understand that no, my account hadn't just crashed, but simply <strong>I can't even see my own messages if published in a <strong>language not present in the list< /strong> of those accepted by me, which by default is only English. I had to <strong>by hand</strong> add at least Italian (I added all the languages while I was at it) to the white list.<br>
It's certainly a <strong>programming oversight</strong>, because this behavior wouldn't make the slightest sense from the point of view of user experience design... but <strong>it's not good at all!</strong></ p>

<p>However, your <strong>publications</strong> are <strong>editable</strong>, which is great. Here too we are on a par with Mastodon, but <strong>above</strong> other federated platforms.</p>

<h3>The main message flows</h3>

<p>Some points may be pros and cons, depending on your point of view.</p>

<p>The <strong>absence</strong> of a <strong>federated timeline</strong> is a bit inconvenient, because it makes the discovery of new content more difficult, but it's not the end of the world: as on other services, <strong>in the home</strong> (which here is called "<strong>Inbox</strong>") <strong>arrive</strong> the shares of <strong>messages from unknown users</strong> strong> by the users who follow each other, so every now and then <strong>you can discover</strong> new profiles from there.<br>
At the same time, however, <strong>the server does not risk</strong> having to deal with <strong>unmanageable quantities of data traffic</strong> over time, which will instead be proportional only to the users' activity on the instance and those directly followed by them.</p>

<p>The <strong>lack of local history</strong>, however, will probably be felt if you want to host a server for your group of friends. Well, maybe not even too much: Epicyon seems to be designed to <strong>have a few active local users</strong>, a dozen at most, and at that point we all simply follow each other.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Timeline-Pixel.png" alt="A part of the home timeline, seen on smartphones with the "Pixel" theme." ></p>

<h3>Excellent performance</h3>

<p>The <strong>idea</strong> of running a program of this type <strong>without</strong> any centralized <strong>database</strong> system, instead having it store all the data as files scattered throughout the system's file system, I also <strong>like</strong> it a lot conceptually, but it has concrete <strong>scalability limits</strong>.<br>
Who knows what would happen if I tried to set up a project like "Epicyon<strong>.uno</strong>" or "Epicyon<strong>.social</strong>"... I imagine a huge disaster.</strong> p>

<p>But basically, when not pushed to the limit, this software really <strong>performs</strong> as promised.<br>
With <strong>htop</strong> we can go into details: on my <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211120100907/https://www.alliedelec.com/m/ d/4252b1ecd92888dbb9d8a39b536e7bf2.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 3</a></strong>, in moments of <strong>quasi-stall</strong> (in which I am not using the application, but the server obviously has tasks to perform), the <strong>CPU</strong> usage is around <strong>3%</strong> (out of a total theoretical maximum of 400%, considering the 4 cores), and the <strong>RAM</strong> used between <strong>40 and 70 MB</strong> (approximately 4.5 to 7.5% of the RAM of a Pi3). The HTML generated by the server, then, is essential, and the client therefore takes just <strong>a few moments</strong> to receive it.</p>

<p>The software didn't promise not to have terrifying bugs, so in fact you can't complain about that, but <strong>the few promises</strong> it made <strong>it kept</strong> very well . Oh God, the program actually claims to be <a href="https://gitlab.com/bashrc2/epicyon/-/blob/66203c6558a1bb4fa2a405c45e84f786b606b499/epicyon.py#L7" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" >in "Production/Stable" status</a>, so this excuse holds up to a certain point...</p>

<h3>Reactions to posts</h3>

<p>The good things, fortunately, don't end here!<br>
I was immediately pleased to notice that the platform allows you to <strong>react to messages</strong> using <strong>emoji</strong>, as well as allowing the classic sending of appreciation for the post - the standard "like", so to speak, which here is a heart.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/React-LCD.png" alt="Screen for selecting a reaction to a message (viewed with the "LCD" theme )"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <strong>separation</strong> of reactions from appreciation is decidedly <strong>not very intelligent</strong>.<br>
This opinion is not only mine, but also that of the developers of Misskey and, I believe (I have never checked in person) also Pleroma: reacting from there to a message coming from a platform that does not support reactions (like Mastodon) translates into an appreciation received from that other server. On Epicyon, however, <strong>reacting</strong> to a publication that comes from less feature-rich instances <strong>is virtually useless</strong>.<br>
On top of all that, I don't think there's even a way to see a list of all the messages you've reacted to; so, <strong>goodbye to the idea</strong> of using <strong>reactions</strong> at least <strong>as a personal filter</strong> of posts read and liked over time.</p>

<h3>The search</h3>

<p>When finding other people's publications through the platform interface, we have just <strong>a few fewer limitations</strong> compared to what we see on Mastodon.<br>
The <strong>text search</strong> with normal keywords is unfortunately limited to your own messages, but there are other options for other situations: in addition to being able to <strong>search by hashtag</strong> (which, by the way, the search interface recommends), apparently you can even search <strong>by emoji</strong>! However, I did not test this additional function, having only noticed it too late.<br>
Finally, you can <strong>search for elements</strong> relating to the functions of the sharing economy (which I am now getting to): skills, or objects and services.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Search-Pixel.png" alt="The screen for starting a search (seen from the "Pixel" theme)"> </p>

<h2>Advanced features</h2>

<p>From Epicyon, continuing, there are <strong>different modes</strong> that can be set for a <strong>message</strong>. There is no need to explain those in common with the major platforms, but some deserve special attention.</p>

<h3>Collaborative economy</h3>

<p>One of the key points of Epicyon, at least this is the idea, is made up of its features oriented towards the so-called "<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economia_collaborativa" rel="noopener nofollow " target="_blank">sharing economy</a>".<br>
It is possible to create posts that describe <strong>objects or services</strong> that you are <strong>looking for</strong> or are <strong>making available</strong>, specifying the relevant <strong>category< /strong> and (optionally) a <strong>price</strong>.<br>
These messages can appear in the <strong>timelines</strong> dedicated to them, and by default they are not federated; the server admin can specify a list of third-party instances with which to federate this type of post.<br>
On your profile, you can then indicate a <strong>list of your <strong>skills</strong>, with a percentage level.</p>

<p>Unfortunately - and here we are now starting to notice a trend, with malfunctions - for me to publish the <strong>request</strong> for something <strong>it worked</strong>, while trying to post a < strong>offer</strong> (as a new message, not related to the previous one) <strong>had no effect</strong>. I tried twice but, really no, the new post didn't appear.</p>

<h3>Mixture of modes</h3>

<p><strong>Damn</strong>, because here too an indigestible <strong>salad</strong> has been made: those which are <strong>modalities</strong> definable as "reception", that is, which determine who the message will reach and how it will be displayed - public, unlisted, followers-only, or direct - are mixed with modes that I can define as "typological", that is, which set the post as normal (containing text and/or attached files), or as a special category.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Post-Modes-Pixel.png" alt="Publish screen, with the mode selection menu open (viewed with the "Pixel" theme)."></p>

<p>In practice, this means that <strong>you</strong> cannot change the <strong>privacy</strong> level of those <strong>special</strong> type posts strong>.<br>
If this is perhaps not a problem for the <em>sharing economy</em> functions, which do not even place elements on the user profile page, it could be a problem for the surveys, which are unfortunately implemented as a post type and not as an option additional for normals.</p>

<h3>Problems with surveys</h3>

<p>The fact that they necessarily have to be public is not the most <strong>bizarre</strong> thing about the <strong>implementation of polls</strong>, because there are worse things.</p>

<p>It seems that <strong>select</strong> (with the dedicated buttons, obviously) one of the available <strong>options</strong>, and then press save, does not have the same effect in the backend that other platforms have ; <strong>you create a response comment</strong> (visible as such from other servers), as if you had written the desired option by hand in a new message under the same discussion.<br>
Not only does this screw up the anonymity of the polls as provided by all other applications, but it just doesn't work: that strange response is not added to the vote counters on the poll.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Polls-Bug.png" alt="A poll created by Epicyon, voted on and displayed by both Epicyon and Mastodon. Please note the problem described."></p>

<h3>A look at events</h3>

<p>In any case, for any type of publication you can optionally <strong>set a position</strong> (by inserting an OpenStreetMap link - which didn't work at all for me) <strong>and a date</strong> strong>, both of which are potentially useful if you want to report an <strong>event</strong>, something Epicyon expects.</p>

<p>Dated posts should also show up in the <strong>calendar section</strong> of the app. I didn't check whether at least this thing worked, unfortunately, but I tried the "<strong>reminder</strong>" message, and it works: a message of this type <strong>comes</strong> from your account, like <strong> >direct</strong>, at the appointed time; in addition to appearing in the calendar, it is accessible in a <strong>button</strong> (<strong>highlighted</strong> with an alternative color) that appears in the navigation bar at the top of the home page.</p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Reminder-Pixel.png" alt="The screen showing a triggered reminder (viewed with the "Pixel" theme). "></p>

<h3>Non-micro blogging</h3>

<p>The last mode that can be set for posts is that of "<strong>article</strong>", therefore having a <strong>title and no strict limit</strong> <strong>for the body</strong> ; something foreseen by ActivityPub, suitable for more classic blogging, and which has already been observed around for some time with WriteFreely, Plume, Lemmy, or Friendica.</p>

<p>Articles should end up on your profile page... but that doesn't happen for me. The <strong>functionality</strong> is <strong>broken</strong> and the <strong>only way</strong> to find articles, your own or those of other instance users, is to <strong>go through for the dedicated timeline.<br>
Ah, <strong>in addition to this</strong> here, which is actually a <strong>timeline</strong> with special visualization, there is also <strong>one</strong> that puts into <strong> >show only multimedia messages</strong>, a bit like it was Pixelfed.</p>

<h3>Instance-level contents</h3>

<p>These special views here can, among other things, be set as <strong>instance mode</strong>, in a way that makes <strong>navigation of local posts</strong> possible <strong> to those who visit the site</strong> without logging in.</p>

<p>Actually, there is also a third option for the instance type: "<strong>news</strong>". This highlights the <strong>news</strong> arriving from the <strong>flows set</strong> by the server administrators.<br>
That's right, in this sense Epicyon provides particularly interesting tools: the news, set by <strong>RSS</strong> sources, appear in a <strong>sidebar</strong> on desktop. Based on further configuration they can be subject to <strong>filters</strong>, which automatically add <strong>hashtag</strong> or <strong>content warnings</strong> /em>) based on the text.<br>
The server also displays a feed that aggregates all the news that it gradually downloads.</p>

<p>On the opposite side, still on desktop, there is a <strong>further bar</strong>, which makes <strong>external links</strong> conveniently available. Some <strong>point</strong> to information or documentation of the instance, while others can be set by administrators and point <strong>to any URL</strong>. </p>

<p><img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Featured-LCD.png" alt="The "Featured" screen, which appears selectable from a dedicated button in the navigation bar when the instance is set to "news" mode (viewed from the "LCD" theme). The flow of articles written by server members appears in the center."></p>

<h2>Loads of mess!</h2>

<p>So far, all in all, this piece of software <strong>didn't seem <strong>bad</strong> at all: with some small inconveniences, sure, but no program more complex than a <em> Hello World</em>can never be perfect, and this Epicyon still has some <strong>solid points in its favor</strong>.<br>
The problem, the big mess, is that the serious problems that exist are enormous. I dare say <strong>mastodontic</strong>, for a platform whose animal is large, but not elephantine!</p>

<p>There's not much space to discuss here, so I'd rather do a quick <strong>overview</strong>.<br>
Something about a good part of these errors came out in the server logs, but in a too generic way, and therefore (even if I didn't want to waste too much time on it) ) I couldn't figure out why certain problems occurred.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After a few minutes of sending them, <strong>some</strong> of your messages may randomly disappear from the instance</strong>. They can no longer be found by browsing around, reaching them directly from the link returns a 404 error, but <strong>on third-party instances</strong> that received them in time they <strong>remain</strong> visible. Similarly, some messages may disappear from the profile page of another user who is local to your instance, when you go looking for them.</p></li>
<li><p>By the law of retaliation, <strong>some messages appear</strong> as <strong>duplicates</strong> in certain situations. I've noticed this definitely happens for posts on your profile page (<a href="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Self-Profile-Pixel.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target ="_blank">image here üñºÔ∏è</a>), where they even <strong>split into small groups</strong>, but potentially also for <strong>any post</strong> on the personal timeline <strong>if done some action</strong>like <em>boost</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of <strong>interactions</strong> to posts, I have seen that sometimes <strong>they may not be successful</strong>. I remember perfectly well that it can happen with the <strong>reaction</strong> function - in one case I <strong>had to try</strong> a second time to assign one to a message for the action to work - and it seems to me it could happen also with heart and sharing, but I didn't frame these two cases well.</p></li>
<li><p>Remaining on interactions, this time with profiles: it is tragic that <em>in some cases</em>* trying to follow</strong> some accounts <strong>doesn't work</strong> > precisely. By pressing "Follow", I sometimes had to wait a few tens of seconds for the user to actually appear in my following list, without any indication from the application; <strong>other times</strong>, even <strong>waiting</strong> for hours (days...) or trying again several times <strong>didn't help</strong> anything. It seems that the problem does not depend on the software the remote instance is running on, so I have no idea why it happens.</p></li>
<li><p>There are <strong>two different pages</strong> that can appear <strong>for profiles</strong>: one with the view of recent posts (of which I linked a screenshot above), but no options other than follow, and one with several options (of which I leave a <a href="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Profile-Options-Pixel.png" rel= "noopener nofollow" target="_blank">image here üñºÔ∏è</a>). <strong>Sometimes the first one opens, other times the second.</strong> It doesn't center the part of the application from which you come to open the screen, and I don't see any way to go from one section to another. The second seems to come up more commonly when you already follow the account you're viewing, but not always. <strong>If you want to see the messages</strong> of a particular user, <strong>but the software has decided not to</strong> at that moment, in practice, <strong>you attack</strong> .</p></li>
<li><p>Really strange bug: <strong>Misskey accounts appear with an alphanumeric ID instead of the normal username</strong> (only the first part - the one that indicates the domain is okay). There are no problems if you try to refer to an account with its real username, because the message arrives (or the search succeeds, if that is the function you are using)... however, <strong>if you are by replying to the account in question, <strong>the suggested username will be the strange one, <strong>which</strong> doesn't exist and therefore <strong>doesn't work</strong>. Even if it didn't break messages, this problem would still be annoying, because it wouldn't allow you to understand at a glance who you're talking to... I can already imagine what it would be like to participate in threads with many users.<br>
<img src="{{< assetsRoot >}}/Media/Epicyon-Dec-2022/Misskey-ID-Bug.png" alt="A Misskey user, displayed on Epicyon with correct profile photo, name, and description ( censored here), but username taken from nowhere ("@91f967c3pb@misskey.social")."></p></li>
<li><p>Some <strong>instance settings</strong> are <strong>sentient</strong> and <strong>change state on their own</strong>. Sometimes for example, after a server restart, <strong>the option that opens</strong> new recordings</strong> to anyone <strong>reactivates</strong> by itself. Something also happened regarding the instance mode, which went from standard to "news" without me setting it that way; however, this might not be a bug, maybe some action I did as admin (and which I don't remember, here you go) had this side effect but expected by the developers. We'll never know, but it's <strong>scary</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some <strong>problems with retrieval</strong>, and/or excessive caching, <strong>of account metadata by third-party instances</strong>. I've checked several other servers, running some tests that lead me to some <em>inconclusive conclusions</em>; in particular, <strong>regarding the profile photos</strong> (the main square one):</p>

<ul>
<li>Mastodon, I've tried several instances, completely refuses to see the <em>picture</em>, and puts the elephant placeholder in its place.</li>
<li>Misskey goes like this: some instances put their placeholder, while others load the banner photo as a profile image (which however I have never set, and therefore I see that Epicyon puts one on its own based on the theme of 'instance; nice surprise!)... I won't ask any questions, go.</li>
<li>Friendica (of which I was only able to use one instance), however, can see the photo. Friendica, however, is a slightly more advanced software, and internally it uses complex methods to obtain the metadata of many types of Web resources.
All in all, it could be a <strong>caching problem</strong> (who knows if on my server's side, or the others), and maybe not malformed data, but it's still something that <strong>doesn't work</strong> >.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>



<h2>And now?</h2>

<p>The <strong>dream</strong> of a <strong>lightweight but feature-rich</strong> ActivityPub <strong>server</strong> has inexorably <strong>collapsed</strong>, there is no really nothing else to say. After just seeing the first few problems <strong>I thought I wanted to keep Epicyon</strong> for at least a week, so as to test it properly, <strong>but</strong> in the end it started to behave too badly. <strong>I had to take it out</strong> after just 2 days.<br>
It's really <strong>a shame</strong>, then, that it proved to be <strong>too broken</strong> to be realistically usable. For now I have to opt for other software, and maybe I found something good - and this is a story for a next time - but I really hope <strong>that Epicyon can</strong> in future <strong>become usable</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Fortunately</strong>, even if at the hands of just one person, therefore slowly, <strong>development is progressing</strong> at a pace of <a href="https://gitlab. com/bashrc2/epicyon/activity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">several commits per day</a>.<br>
Speaking of this, after having done a <strong>touch and go</strong> look at the sources, I have to say one thing: compared to more established servers, <strong>the code</strong> of this one <strong> It seems to me to be in pretty bad shape. The files are not well divided into folders, there are some that number in the hundreds (or even <a href="https://gitlab.com/bashrc2/epicyon/-/blob/66203c6558a1bb4fa2a405c45e84f786b606b499/daemon.py" rel=" noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a thousand!</a>) of kilobytes, and there are huge functions in which loops and controls appear under many, too many levels of indentation.<br>
I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of the person who is maintaining it because, as things are, I fear that <strong>fixing this software</strong> to make it work properly <strong>will not be a simple thing</strong>, and it won't take a short time at all...</p>

<p>Looking at <strong>all the available settings</strong> can give a good insight into what some of the potential of any platform is.
