Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;This year, my most assiduous followers know, I enjoy the privilege of not having to take the final exam: I already gave enough last year, while now I find myself in the much worse vortex of university. But, for those who don&#39;t give my online profiles the necessary attention: it&#39;s okay, you&#39;ve discovered it now.</description>

Because searching on the web I can&#39;t find a shred of an announcement page or one that collects the jobs.</description>

The first part was quite long, however, and I&#39;m afraid that it might eclipse the really important part, that of my dangerously original solution. So, in this article I only talk about my problems; what comes out later will be dedicated to my do-it-yourself.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Maybe a year ago, partly out of curiosity and partly because I already imagined that it might have been something convenient, I developed a marginal interest in smartphones equipped with complete physical keyboards.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the damn numeric keypads, which you still see on non-smart phones today, I mean keyboards with dozens of individual keys dedicated for letters and symbols.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Today&amp;rsquo;s Web is unquestionably very different from that of 20 years ago, and it changes more and more with each passing year.&#xA;Looking at the positive sides of progress is always very easy and reassuring, and for this reason we rarely think about the dark sides which, in many, many things, exist.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;In recent days I have settled the first matters regarding making the site available on the Tor network. There are those who will call me exaggerated for even having the thought of doing something like this, but there is little that can be done.&#xA;If nothing has gone wrong, the Onion service can still be reached at this address: onmfrk2acl4xdeawfjg3nfepq7gcufolctmhiwwxpcknazus5bxzxhqd.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;One thing I did months ago that, so far, has proven to be a winning choice, was install a Linux-based operating system, in persistent mode, * on* a small USB stick.&#xA;The reasons why I wanted to do it initially are perhaps simple and banal, but it gave me, upon careful analysis, some unexpected advantages that were much more than welcome.</description>
