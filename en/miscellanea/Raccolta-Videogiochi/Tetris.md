The game created specifically to make people fit together squares of particular shapes that fall from the sky.  
Puzzle game very particular in its simplicity where, as the game difficulty increases, the lack of quick reflexes can cause the game to end prematurely.

## Tetris Effect

Tetris effect adds ambient atmospheres to Tetris with many different themes. Visual and sound effects work to enhance each other, and allow for total immersion, even in a game that remains simply made of falling cubes. Hundreds of thousands of particles everywhere, shapes, colors, attractive music, this is its formula. It has some flaws, such as being particularly heavy for a Tetris and having controls that aren't terribly responsive, but that doesn't mean it should be thrown away. It remains to enjoy.
