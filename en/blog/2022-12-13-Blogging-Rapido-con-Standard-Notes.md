<p>I'd say I've been using <strong><a href="https://standardnotes.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Standard Notes</a></strong> for a long time as < strong>personal notes</strong>app.<br>
Years ago I chose it for its being <strong>free and open-source</strong>, but at the same time very <strong>clean, well-kept, and functional</strong>. It was a perfect fit at a time when I was looking for something that supported data encryption that works, without affecting usability.</p>

<p>Without dwelling on why I liked continuing to use it, then I stopped, and then I started again until now, we need to delve deeper into one of its <strong>integrated functions</strong> in particular: <strong> <a href="https://listed.to">Listed</a></strong>.<br>
It is a <strong>blogging</strong> platform designed by the same developers as Standard Notes, and available for self-hosting or <strong>free</strong> use on the official instance. Although I have never really used it before, I found the concept and its application interesting from the beginning.</p>

<h2>A quick need</h2>

<p>A few days ago, however, I started playing around with <a href="https://listed.to/@ChatGPT_Experiences">ChatGPT</a>. This is a totally different question, yes, but it's relevant because I asked myself a question: all these conversations I'm having with artificial intelligence, where can I put them to keep them integral, organised, findable and accessible to anyone, and <strong>easy to load</strong> for me?</p>

<p>The choice was about to<strong>use <a href="https://gitlab.com/octtspacc/staticoso" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">staticoso</a></ strong>, <strong>my generator</strong> of static sites that I already use for <a href="https://sitoctt.octt.eu.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> sitoctt</a>, but then <strong>I thought better of it</strong>.</p>

<p>I thought that, in fact, I want to actually make my collection of experiences findable on the Web. The <strong>problem</strong> here, however, which I have been able to bitterly observe in all these months, is how my site example is, how to say... <strong>Search engines don't give a damn</strong>. üò≠<br>
Besides this being a separate topic, it should be noted that the blame for the horrendous fate of my site does not depend on its code; It's the fault of the domain and/or the host. So, no, I will never abandon my static one: just changing the generator (and consequently the templates) with a more serious one wouldn't solve any problem.</p>

<p>In short, I had to completely <strong>trash</strong> the idea of<strong>hosting on GitHub and GitLab</strong>, and think about something else.</p>

<ul>
Google <li><strong>Blogger</strong>? The editorial experience leaves something to be desired on mobile.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress</strong>? It would be OK, but we know what could happen in many years to data inserted into a complex system; and WordPress is very complex. I struggled to find a <a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">little program that converts your backup</a> XML in Markdown file... which will most likely break in a few years, being unofficial, as apparently the WordPress team has a habit of changing the structure of that XML from time to time; other conversion solutions that I had found a moment earlier were a few years old and didn't work, so to speak.</li>
<li>Maybe <strong><a href="https://writefreely.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">WriteFreely</a></strong>? I already have an account on the <a href="https://noblogo.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Devol instance</a>, but the blog limit for each account is 5 and I didn't want to potentially waste one.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://joinplu.me" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Plume</a></strong>, maybe? This other blogging platform seemed nice, hosted by many and compatible with ActivityPub (not a necessity for me, but still a nice bonus), but it doesn't allow you to set custom CSS; serious shortcoming for this use case of mine, since there is no other way to layout everything in the specific way I need to represent a chat without boilerplate for each paragraph of HTML.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The choice of Listed</h2>

<p>My ideas were finished and, since I was in a hurry to put on this site and start uploading the experiences I had with ChatGPT, considering how <em>my goodness</em> it was <strong>convenient</strong> to copy and paste things <strong>directly into Standard Notes</strong>, this was a good time to try <strong>Listed</strong>.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm a little worried about the prospect that the weekly backup file of notes could become tens of MB large, but the die has now been cast.<br>
I could create a second account to use only for ChatGPT notes, exporting them from the primary one and importing them there, and then deleting them from the first account to lighten the collection, but there are problems. Maybe I can transfer the username, but the links to the individual posts will be broken, because they include automatic IDs, and therefore a redirect to the home page for those who follow an old one. Also, old guestbook messages aren't copied over, and I don't think email subscriptions are transferred either.</p>



<h2>The thought of "what a drag"</h2>

<p>All in all however, for this limited purpose <strong>I appreciated</strong> how <strong>efficient</strong> it is to have <strong>Standard Notes</strong> as the <strong>final</strong> part of the</strong> > my <strong>workflow</strong>. It seems to me to greatly reduce the <em>"I'm annoyed" effect</em>.</p>

<p>Considering the pleasure of the discovery, I <strong>reflected</strong> for a moment on how the <strong><em>"what a pain" factor</em></strong> is one of the things that < strong>keeps me from updating</strong>the ctt site more frequently.</p>

<p>Let's leave aside the thematic pages, which are <em>beasts apart</em>; let's leave aside the long posts, which require strong inspiration and enough writing time; but what the hell, at least <strong>something</strong> for the MicroBlog, which is all the rage, I would <strong>like</strong> to create it <strong>more often</strong>! But <strong>I just don't feel like it</strong>, for some reason, considering all the process I have to do.<br>
To tell the truth, I had already immediately got into the habit of starting to write a post in Standard Notes, so as to be able to manage everything more flexibly, perhaps quickly switching from one device to another. However, if I had to start writing something not long and elaborate, to be published as soon as possible, I just didn't feel like taking action.</p>

<p>"<em>But why don't I switch to <strong>Listed at least for</strong> my <strong>microblog</strong>?</em>", I therefore think. Well, there's a reason why I even got to the point of making my own static site generator: I need it!...<em>And even if I no longer needed it and could therefore stop using it, I honestly wouldn't even want to think about it. do something like this, after all the work!</em> üòñ</p>

<h2>Limitations of Listed</h2>

<p>However, to put it well, <strong>Listed is quite bare-bones</strong>: it barely allows you to insert custom <strong>CSS</strong>, and to format posts in <strong>Markdown</strong> and a narrow <strong>subset</strong> of <strong>HTML</strong>. I propose my analyzes of the latter below:</p>

<ul>
<li>All <strong>elements</strong> that are <strong>inline in nature are</strong> automatically <strong>inserted into a block</strong> <code class="prettyprint"><p> </code> (for example, you cannot have <code class="prettyprint"><body><span>Err</span></body></code>, it will always be <code class="prettyprint"> <body><p><span>Err</span></p></body></code>);</li>
<li>Any element <strong>attribute</strong> that is not <code class="prettyprint">id</code>, <code class="prettyprint">class</code>, or <code class= "prettyprint">style</code>, (and <code class="prettyprint">href</code> or <code class="prettyprint">src</code>, as well as I believe stuff like <code class=" prettyprint">title</code>, <code class="prettyprint">width</code>, or <code class="prettyprint">height</code>, in appropriate cases) <strong>is thrown away</strong > go: so forget, for example, deviating from the default configuration of the platform regarding the behavior of the links (the <code class="prettyprint">rel</code> is not touched);</li>
<li><strong>Certain elements</strong> just don't work: those with non-standard tags (custom in short, like <code class="prettyprint"><pincopallino></code>) <strong>are eliminated</strong> strong>, as well as <code class="prettyprint"><script></code>, <code class="prettyprint"><link></code>, and apparently stuff like <code class="prettyprint" too ><video></code> - but <code class="prettyprint"><iframe></code>, so to speak, works, and luckily so does my beloved <code class="prettyprint"><details>< /code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very clear that <strong>it cannot replace</strong> 100% absolutely <strong>any section of the ctt site</strong>, not even that of the MicroBlog, and even if it could it would create fragmentation: the main site does not it would contain all the posts in a centralized way, and anyone interested would therefore have to follow 2 different sites.</p>

<h2>The blogoctt with Standard Notes</h2>

<p>I was <em>almost</em> about to give up, but luckily I have a flash of genius: <em>But I can <strong>write on Standard Notes</strong>, and have the <strong>notes that Do they automatically <strong>synchronize</strong> as files <strong>on the site</strong>? ...No, there's no way. No, wait, who said that? I say there is a way.</em></p>

<p>Now, Standard Notes, as I said, uses a client-side data encryption system, so to access the notes from your account <strong>you should use</strong> a specific <strong>software</strong> minimum <strong>specialised</strong>.<br>
There is <em>sn-cli</em>, the official command line client, which could be useful for creating scripts... but <a href="https://github.com/jonhadfield/sn- cli/issues/33" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">it seems to have been abandoned</a>: nothing to be done.</p>

<h3>Solution "my way"</h3>

<p>So, here too I speak, and I say: <em>Who said that I have to do things properly and use "real" APIs?</em><br>
I say that, since for some reason the <strong>HTML</strong> of a blog <strong>on Listed</strong> (specifically, the page <a href="https://listed.to/ @u8/all">/all</a>, the only one that seems to me to really include everything, and not just the last X posts) <strong>include as</strong> string <strong>JSON</strong> i data of <strong>all the posts</strong>, then I can simply <strong>publish</strong> to Listed <strong>by Standard Notes</strong> and have a <strong>program that does</strong> the dirt - but in this case really simple, since it only has to download and parse 1 file - <strong>scraping</strong> work.</p>

<p><em>And script fu scripto.</em> I leave it here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/octtspacc/sitoctt/-/blob/main/Scripts/ListedDownsync.js" rel= "noopener nofollow" target="_blank">gitlab.com/octtspacc/sitoctt/Scripts/ListedDownsync.js</a>; Be careful though, there is <em>nothing nice to read</em>, also because I haven't yet implemented everything that should serve me in the long term, but <strong>for those who want to use it</strong> it's there. <br>
It is technically <strong>site-independent</strong> and static, as it <strong>saves</strong> simple <strong>Markdown files</strong> to disk (even if the syntax of the metadata lines written in them it is mine; therefore, in this case, some text strings in the program should be changed to support the more classic YAML metadata format).</p>

<p>I don't want to say that I really thought of everything, but I came close.<br>
No, I still can't decide - due to my <em>paturnia</em> - which standard to use to indicate special blocks (of metadata, or of HTML not to be interpreted by Listed's SSG).<br>
No, I haven't yet created the script to start as a <strong>cronjob</strong> on the server, which every now and then should <strong>download the data from</strong>the <strong>Listed</strong> blog and < strong>update</strong> the files in the<strong>Git repository</strong> if there are updates.<br>
However, I thought about the really mandatory things, such as the possibility for the synchronization program not to overwrite a file already in the repo if this specifies the thing in the metadata. Suppose some mess happens, and I have to modify the post data for the ctt site without touching the note data on Standard Notes: by setting this flag, the synchronization script will not replace it the next time it runs.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>How to conclude, then.<br>
Today <strong>I have already written too much</strong> (it turned out to be a blog article and not a microblog!), and I'll end it here. But I sincerely hope that all this new efficiency and convenience, having additional <strong>technology that works for me</strong>, and does not force me to work for it <em>(in theory, anyway, the problems must come out , otherwise I'm not me!)</em>, may it <strong>make me write more</strong> and <strong>with more pleasure</strong>. Whether on the <strong><a href="https://sitoctt.octt.eu.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sitoctt</a></strong>, or on the stone slabs .</p>

<p>Ah, yes, this here was the <strong>first post</strong> on <a href="https://listed.to/@u8">my <strong>Listed blog</strong>< /a>, it's right to point this out for those reading from the ctt site... but I hope that at least the Listed version of the blog can be indexed well and <strong>discovered by more people</strong>, while we're at it.<br >
It is precisely in the hope of achieving this objective that I am accepting some <strong>compromises</strong> when I write here, such as doing without macros (which I can use with statiso, while here they would produce holes in text and broken links), to so that the articles can also be effectively consulted from the Listed pages.</p>
