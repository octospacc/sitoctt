<!-- I should finish writing this... --->

Here I am on my umpteenth little adventure.  
This time I'm dealing with some stupid DRM, which I could, like many people, try to circumvent in a super-studied and perfect way... but, even in this case, the simplest solutions are the best.

My solution, however ugly and inelegant, is universal.  
I didn't set out to write scraping programs to maybe download books from sites, or to convert the strange formats of offline readers into more common formats. Who wants to start repaying everything you need, and 4 times, once for a different digital book supplier?

I decided to use screen capture. Not handmade, clearly.  
In any case, it is precisely from here that a path is born, aimed at solving small problems that suddenly arise, and at increasing efficiency under various factors.

## Why all this?

The reasons that push me to get into this mess are multiple.  
Of course, it's because I need digital books, considering how convenient they are. Since I started high school I only carry my lagging tablet, no paper brick books (except for a few bad apples, like the physics and Italian literature books, which are not provided digitally...). If I didn't do this, my backpack would explode and my thin loli back would shatter.  
But why do I have to extract the books, and not use the publishers' applications?

**Apps don't work**
: The first reason is simply this. Some apps simply work badly, being slow to load the menu, a book, or even a page... when with a PDF or even images seen in the gallery I wouldn't have the slightest problem. Others don't work at all! They lose their session all the time, or even are completely broken and think I'm offline, and I can't access my books.

**I don't like proprietary software and DRM**
: In general, whenever possible I always try to do without proprietary software, preferring free tools to do the things I need to do. Proprietary software itself, however, is not necessarily always 100% bad, because sometimes it still gives you freedom 0<sup>[[↗️](https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_libero# Le_%C2%ABquattro_libert%C3%A0%C2%BB)]</sup>, i.e. the possibility of always using the software for any purpose. Well, DRMs take away this too, they are the absolute inexcusable evil and, if already everything that I use for my purposes does not have DRMs (because it has never had them, or because they have been removed, by me or other people), it would be It's nice to resolve this issue also for school books, which I use only because the curriculum requires it.

**Being able to preserve and share books**
: Paper books, once you buy them, you own them. You can do whatever the hell you want with them, and they don't disappear overnight because some burnt nut head decided the license is expired. Why shouldn't it be like this for digital ones? I'm not into it, so I want to preserve them - as a matter of principle, not because I think I'll reopen them after school... personally I prefer to search the web for anything I find I want or need to know. As a bonus, I will also upload them online, so that anyone who wants to download them can do so (if they want it for personal study and not for school use, since these publishers reprint the books every year and schools always fall for their scam).
