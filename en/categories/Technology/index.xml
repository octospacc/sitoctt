      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Note: This article should have first explained the Switch dock issues, but then continued and ended with &gt;total development of my alternative solution. The first part was quite long, however, and I&#39;m afraid that it might eclipse the really important part, that of my dangerously original solution. So, in this article I only talk about my problems; what comes out later will be dedicated to my do-it-yourself.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Standard Notes as my personal notes app for a long time now.&#xA;Years ago I chose it for its being free and open-source, but at the same time very clean, tidy, and functional. It was a perfect fit at a time when I was looking for something that supported data encryption that works, without affecting usability.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Almost two months ago, the DSpacc came to mind somewhat by chance; first as a concept, talking about it with people online, and then directly as the little object that I proudly own.&#xA;This thing of mine has seen dust, glory, war, and despair. This is exactly what I should have talked about today, what I did recently to remove some dust and thus bring my device back to glory.</description>

Enough, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to say anything else; after all, among connoisseurs, we understand each other. A console that, 15 years ago, was able to innovate the market with the same spirit with which the Gameboy innovated in its time. A console whose exclusives remain, even today, timeless pearls.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;For almost 7 years I have had an Acer laptop, Aspire V3-572G, undoubtedly now a bit old, without praise and with some infamy.&#xA;When it was purchased, it was essentially a mid-range notebook like any other, without any notable features. I mean, I used it quite a bit and it more or less always did what it was supposed to, until about 2 years ago I started demanding to use heavy games and development tools, at which point the new (desktop) PC was great.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Maybe a year ago, partly out of curiosity and partly because I already imagined that it might have been something convenient, I developed a marginal interest in smartphones equipped with complete physical keyboards.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the damn numeric keypads, which you still see on non-smart phones today, I mean keyboards with dozens of individual keys dedicated for letters and symbols.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;One thing I did months ago that, so far, has proven to be a winning choice, was install a Linux-based operating system, in persistent mode, * on* a small USB stick.&#xA;The reasons why I wanted to do it initially are perhaps simple and banal, but it gave me, upon careful analysis, some unexpected advantages that were much more than welcome.</description>
