Be careful, though: not for the exam itself (the last in a series of extra-curricular ones, precisely), very simple for me, which I don&#39;t care about except the certification!</description>

(I hope not exactly at the time I&#39;m writing this post üò∞) How much money will the entertainment lobbies have spent to ensure that the law was passed with total unanimity?</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;I believe Minecraft can be defined as the modern game (for better or worse) that develops potentially infinite complexity from simple premises. In a good way, obviously: complexity impresses and rewards those who seek it, but the title remains playable for anyone.&#xA;At first it&amp;rsquo;s making &amp;ldquo;houses&amp;rdquo; that are 4x4 holes under the ground, but later it becomes creating titanic installations, purely aesthetic or even totally functional - let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that Minecraft, with its redstone, is Turing-complete.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;From YouTube/2N1TJP1cxmo.&#xA;The best way to describe Mirror&amp;rsquo;s Edge is to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a game in constant motion. Literally standing on the edge of the mirror, the edges of the enormous glass of which the buildings of La Citt√† are made, one runs and jumps without any brakes.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;In Minesweeper (in Italian officially &amp;ldquo;Minefield&amp;rdquo;) you have a game grid in which bombs have been randomly placed (by an algorithm). To win, you need to locate them all without exploding any of them.&#xA;The rules are simple, but the game easily reaches high levels of complexity and has an I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-what that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without.</description>

      <description>Caution&#xA;The content of this page has been entirely machine-translated into English, from Italiano. Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;2048 is a simple puzzle game in which you have a grid of randomly generated numbered tiles that you can slide entirely in one of four directions. All numbers are powers of 2, and equal numbers that collide add to become their double.&#xA;If you reach 2048 by adding up the tiles, you win a game, which however can go on even further.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;Since I discovered it a few days ago. I&amp;rsquo;m trying that epic software that is TiddlyWiki.&#xA;I initially found it while looking for something to organize notes in a rich format, that I could use for school, and that was obviously free.&#xA;It is a wiki software, practically in the same category as MediaWiki (the software on which Wikipedia is based), but it has very particular characteristics.</description>

Or rather, it was a period in which I was interested in the concept of using paper as a means of storing small computer data, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I started to feel this taste.</description>

Therefore, it might contain any kind of errors.&#xA;This story, more practical than ever, is incredible in my opinion.&#xA;Not only does it demonstrate what lolis can get to with too much free time, like me; shows how everyone among us has a kind of &amp;ldquo;social fingerprint&amp;rdquo; that, if not adequately disguised, can identify us.</description>
