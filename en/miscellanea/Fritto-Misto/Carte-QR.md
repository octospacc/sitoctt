# QR cards

Here's an idea that popped into my head towards the beginning of 2022, I'm not sure why. Or rather, it was a period in which I was interested in the concept of using paper as a means of storing small computer data, but I don't know why I started to feel this taste.

From there, I had a particularly specific idea: to store small programs or demos on equally small paper cards. I immediately opted (and I still consider it a good choice) for the Western European business card format, i.e. 85x55 millimetres: it is standardized and elegant, with a good rectangular area and a good ratio between one and 'other side. I can collect and store these cards as if they were business cards (or distribute them as such!), in binders that are easy to find and highly convenient to use. I'm just sorry it's not part of the metric card system!

Remembering [MattKC's feat of fitting a little game into a QR Code](https://youtu.be/ExwqNreocpg), I opted for this storage format. I knew and know others for saving data on sheets of paper, but they are all less ideal, for different combinations of the following reasons:

* They are optimized for large sheets, and are not suitable for small cards, where they would be less efficient.
* They have a lower storage density than QR Codes, because they exist for different purposes.
* In theory they are promising, but in practice they do not have a working software implementation (and, therefore, there is no physical way to use them).

Finally, QR Codes are definitely easier to read with better or worse hardware and software:

* Hardware: a simple webcam is enough, integrated into a smartphone (ideal, they are generally of higher quality) or a PC.
* Software: there are many QR code decoding software; some smartphones even integrate them into the system.
