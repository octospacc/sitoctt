<p>Why not make a collection to talk, briefly, about the video games I appreciate? <!-- (In alphabetical order) --><br>
Perhaps, managing to shine the spotlight on some half-unknown gaming experience which however should deserve much more.</p>
<p>It cannot be excluded that in the future, finding inspiration, I could take up and write long and in-depth articles on some of the games that I praise here, unfortunately, in a too &ldquo;touch and run&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>For each game, in addition to a short review peppered with some opinions, I will also try to include multimedia material (photos, videos, and music). Finally, when possible, links for physical purchase and download will be present via an intermission/redirection page.</p>
<!--

<!-- ## The epics

This is the place for the best titles, **the epic, one-of-a-kind titles**, period. And here, it absolutely doesn't matter whether a given game is popular or not: it only matters how important it is to me. -->
<h3 id="span-classtwa-twa-span-a-hat-in-time"><span class="twa twa-🎩">🎩</span> A Hat in Time</h3>
<p>Lively and frenetic 3D platformer, undoubtedly coming from the Super Mario 64 school. The difficulty of the main story is just right, and the game flows pleasantly with an alternation of themes and environments that always feels fresh.<br>
But, in short, the charisma of the protagonist character alone makes you want to play.</p>
<h3 id="span-classtwa-twa-span-animal-crossing"><span class="twa twa-🍃">🍃</span> Animal Crossing</h3>
<p>The premises were creative, but boring: you are a human being who, for some reason, goes on a journey to settle in a village where humanoid animals live with whom you can interact. In the meantime, you have to get into debt with a raccoon who sells you the new house at a very high price, and do what you can to repay, with times that can become infinite. Ah, if you want you can choose your clothing, furnish your house, place flowers in the garden&hellip; and?<br>
Animal Crossing is one of those games that simply needs to be tried to be understood: staying in that world manages to induce calm and joy for reasons that apparently go beyond logic.<br>

<h3 id="span-classtwa-twa-span-splatoon"><span class="twa twa-🐙">🐙</span> Splatoon</h3>
<p>Third person shooter which to say is different from the others is an understatement. Splatoon breaks the genre&rsquo;s expectations of war realism, and features cute, dazzlingly colorful gameplay that never lets up. There are no humans shooting bullets with iron, but squids spilling ink.<br>
Playing in Mollusc Melee (this is the name of the 4-on-4 online battles) is fun, but the depth of the game and the inventiveness of the development team can be seen in story mode.<br>

<h3 id="span-classtwa-twa-span-tetris"><span class="twa twa-🧱">🧱</span> Tetris</h3>
<p>The game created specifically to make people fit together squares of particular shapes that fall from the sky.<br>
Puzzle game very particular in its simplicity where, as the game difficulty increases, the lack of quick reflexes can cause the game to end prematurely.</p>
<h4 id="tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</h4>
<p>Tetris effect adds ambient atmospheres to Tetris with many different themes. Visual and sound effects work to enhance each other, and allow for total immersion, even in a game that remains simply made of falling cubes. Hundreds of thousands of particles everywhere, shapes, colors, attractive music, this is its formula. It has some flaws, such as being particularly heavy for a Tetris and having controls that aren&rsquo;t terribly responsive, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it should be thrown away. It remains to enjoy.<br>

<!-- ## Multi-faceted games

There are certain games that - although technically simple and based on immediate concepts, therefore **implementable** and implemented, at a software level, **infinite times** - can certainly be worthy. Indeed, their simplicity can often be an advantage.  
Basically, here we are talking about classic video games for which there are hundreds of different versions written from scratch. Whenever possible, free implementations are preferred in the ranking. -->
<!-- ## Secret pearls

There are some games that maybe don't reach the point of being epic for me, and that's okay - but they are still small pearls, maybe even tiny.  
Why should I talk about it? Because maybe they are really unknown, or almost so; and that is a real, real shame.

...nothing written yet!

## The free ones

Below I would like to collect some unique video games that in my opinion deserve - even if they do not win any place in the epic ranking - but which in addition to being beautiful in themselves have the added value of being **free software**.

If you really want to try something from this page, and you don't really know what, I would say to look right in this section, and do the developers the greatest pleasure if your experience has been worthy: participate in the development, or even just do your turn advertising. -->
<h3 id="span-classtwa-twa-span-supertuxkart"><span class="twa twa-🏎️">🏎️</span> SuperTuxKart</h3>
<p>A kart racing game with cute and original environments, and many mascots from the world of free software as characters. It has different game modes, from classic racing to missions with specific objectives, solo or multiplayer. In some ways it has more than Mario Kart!<br>
• Official Website: <a href="https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page</a></p>
<!-- ## The rest

I prefer to have this subsection to mention games that, although I liked them enough to end up on this page, are a little less important to me, or a little too well known.  
_Titles that have only one of these two characteristics may also be found in sections above._ -->
<h3 id="span-classtwa-twa-span-light-blue"><span class="twa twa-🧗‍♀️">🧗‍♀️</span> Light blue</h3>
<p>Celeste is a nice little platformer game, with original mechanics and a unique graphic style. But it&rsquo;s too difficult.<br>
I tried to play it many times, but at a certain point in the story the difficulty became too high for me. I should maybe try finishing it in guided mode, since the option is there. Until I&rsquo;ve done it, though, I&rsquo;m not going to look for videos of the ending and spoil stuff, since they say that the value of Celeste lies precisely in its meaning.<br>

<h3 id="span-classtwa-twa-span-pilotwings"><span class="twa twa-✈️">✈️</span> Pilotwings</h3>
<h4 id="pilotwings-resort">Pilotwings Resort</h4>
<p>Pilotwings Resort continues the Pilotwings arcade flight simulation series in a different way. It ends up on a portable console, the 3DS, among other things a console that manages to grab you directly, with its stereoscopic 3D display. The game is set on Wuhu Island, the same place full of history, locations, and mysteries as Wii Sports Resort. The mission mode can in some cases be a real challenge if, like me, you have a mania for platinum&hellip; but the free flight mode is unquestionably relaxing and, perhaps, I would even say more immersive. In it, however, it is not that you do nothing: you have to find, a few at a time, all 120 information rings, passing through them to unlock them.<br>

I believe Minecraft can be defined as the modern game (for better or worse) that develops potentially infinite complexity from simple premises. In a good way, obviously: complexity impresses and rewards those who seek it, but the title remains playable for anyone.
At first it&rsquo;s making &ldquo;houses&rdquo; that are 4x4 holes under the ground, but later it becomes creating titanic installations, purely aesthetic or even totally functional - let&rsquo;s not forget that Minecraft, with its redstone, is Turing-complete.

From YouTube/2N1TJP1cxmo.
The best way to describe Mirror&rsquo;s Edge is to say that it&rsquo;s a game in constant motion. Literally standing on the edge of the mirror, the edges of the enormous glass of which the buildings of La Città are made, one runs and jumps without any brakes.

In Minesweeper (in Italian officially &ldquo;Minefield&rdquo;) you have a game grid in which bombs have been randomly placed (by an algorithm). To win, you need to locate them all without exploding any of them.
The rules are simple, but the game easily reaches high levels of complexity and has an I-don&rsquo;t-know-what that you can&rsquo;t do without.

2048 is a simple puzzle game in which you have a grid of randomly generated numbered tiles that you can slide entirely in one of four directions. All numbers are powers of 2, and equal numbers that collide add to become their double.
If you reach 2048 by adding up the tiles, you win a game, which however can go on even further.

Nonogram (also known as Picross, Crucipixel, and about twenty other names) are puzzles that consist of filling a grid of squares in order to reveal an image, using the numbers at the sides of the sheet to find intersections between rows and columns.
